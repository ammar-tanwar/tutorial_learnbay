# **Tableau Worksheet**


## 1. Overview

A Tableau worksheet has a single view, as well as cards, shelves, data, legends, and analytics panes inside its sidebar.


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial will cover



* Adding a worksheet
* Rename worksheet
* Save and Delete the worksheet
* Reorder worksheet
* Paged workbook

The worksheet on the Tableau screen is where you design the data analysis view. When you make a relationship to a data source, Tableau gives three blank worksheets. You could keep adding worksheets to examine several data views simultaneously on the same screen.


## 3. Adding a worksheet

There are two ways to add a tableau worksheet. 



* Right-click just on the label of the active worksheet then choose ‘New Worksheet’ that arises from the menu to create a new worksheet. 
* To add a worksheet, you could also click on the little button towards the right of the name of the previous sheet.

## 5. Rename Worksheet

By renaming a worksheet, you could give the currently used worksheets suitable names. This makes it simpler to connect the worksheet's name and content. For instance, if we need to identify which sheet contains the vision to know the segment-by-segment profit, we may locate it utilizing the sheet's actual name.

**Renaming the Tableau Worksheet**

Rename Sheet can be found in the menu that arises when users right-click the sheet's name.

The worksheet with the updated name can be viewed in the diagram below.

## 6. Save and Delete the worksheet

A worksheet that already exists could be deleted or saved. The information inside the Tableau desktop environment is better structured as an output. While one could save any worksheet by selecting "Save" from the menu bar, one can also delete a worksheet by following the below instructions.

**Deleting the worksheet**

Right-click on the worksheet's name and select "Delete Sheet" to remove the worksheet from the system.

## 7. Reorder Worksheet

To examine something more effectively, you may sometimes require to rearrange an existing worksheet. Drag the sheet name from its previous location to the appropriate location to perform this quickly and efficiently.

**Reordering the Worksheet**

Select and hold the worksheet title and drag it into the new location to reorganize the worksheet.

On transferring the third worksheet from the left to the new position, as shown in the below screenshot, a vertical black line emerges in the new position.

## 8. Paged Workbook

The presentation of the data is saved in a paged workbook in line with the variables of the dimension or measure, utilizing separate pages per number. 

The efficiency of various product types compared to one another in a particular sales region is a typical example. We have the flexibility of viewing each value for the product type independently or as a set of values since each value is saved on a particular page.

**Creating Paged Workbook**

Worksheets with fields added to the page shelf are included in the paged workbook. Consider the example of examining the earnings of several product subcategories in various locations.

**_Step-1_**

Generate a bar graph with one measure and two dimensions. Drag Region towards the shelves of rows, Measure Profit to the shelves for columns, and the sub-category for dimensions.

**_Step-2_**

To the page shelf, drag the Sub-Category field once again. A page controller has been added automatically and is located just beneath the Pages shelf. The following capabilities are offered by this page control to enable users to move between the pages of a view:



* Navigate to a particular page
* Users can manually scroll the pages.
* automatically change the pages

In this situation, we'll learn how to show pages continuously and go to a particular page. Select Accessories from the drop-down menu on the page control to get to a specific page. A graph appears like the one from the screenshot below.

**_Step-3_**

Click the play button while the show history checkbox is selected for automatic page display. Then, a series of pages from multiple subcategories will automatically play. The shade for the previous values is light, while the shade for the current Sub value is dark.
