# **Chapter 2**


# **MongoDB Database**


## 1. Overview

A document database called MongoDB database is utilized to generate large and highly accessible web applications. It's well known by development teams utilizing agile approaches because to its flexible schema approach.


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial covers



* Create a Database and a Collection
* Drop a Database and a Collection


## 3. How to Create a Database and a Collection in MongoDB?

The first fundamental step with MongoDB is to set up a database and a collection. All the collections are stored in the database, and all the documents are stored in the collection. The appropriate Field values and Field names are provided in each document separately.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-1.PNG"></img>


The document's "Employeeid" and "EmployeeName" fields have the field values "1" and "Smith," respectively. In MongoDB, a collection would then consist of a number of documents.


## 4. Utilizing the "use" command to create a database

In MongoDB, a database is created with the "use" command. If the database doesn't already exist, one will be generated.

The below Output will be displayed following successful command execution:


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-2.PNG"></img>


When the database is generated, MongoDB will immediately switch to it.


## 5. Drop Database

The dropDatabase() Method

An existing database can be deleted using the MongoDB db.dropDatabase() command.

Syntax

**_db.dropDatabase()_**

The identified database will be deleted as a result. It will erase the default "test" database if you do not select anything.

Example

Use the command show dbs to first look through the list of existing databases.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-3.PNG"></img>


Here is the dropDatabase() command to erase the new database "mydb".


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-4.PNG"></img>


Check the databases list now.

## 6. Utilizing insert to create a Collection/Table()

A record, which is nothing more than a document made up of Column names and Values, can be added to a collection in the simplest method possible. A new collection will be generated if the selected one does not already exist.

Syntax

**_db.createCollection(name, options)_**

Name is the name of the collection that will be formed in the command. Options is a document that describes how a collection must be configured.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Parameter</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Type</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Name
   </td>
   <td>String
   </td>
   <td>Name of the collection to be generated
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Options
   </td>
   <td>Document
   </td>
   <td>(Optional) Mention your requirements regarding memory size and indexing.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Only the collection name has to be specified because the options parameters are optional.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Type</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Capped
   </td>
   <td>Boolean
   </td>
   <td>(Optional) If it is true, a capped collection is enabled. When a fixed size collection reaches its maximum size, it is known as a "capped collection" and its oldest records are automatically overwritten. If true is specified, the size parameter must also be selected.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>AutoIndexId
   </td>
   <td>Boolean
   </td>
   <td>(Optional) If it is true, generate an index on the _id column automatically. The default value is false.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Size
   </td>
   <td>Number
   </td>
   <td>(Optional) The highest size in bytes for one capped collection is specified. Users also need to provide this field if capped is true.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Max
   </td>
   <td>Number
   </td>
   <td>(Optional) Defines the maximum documents that can be included in the capped collection.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


MongoDB first examines the size field of the capped collection before examining the max field when adding the document.

As displayed above, the collection would be created if the "insert" command is executed.


## 7. The Drop() Method

The db.collection in MongoDB. To remove a collection from the database, use the drop() function.

Syntax

**_db.COLLECTION_NAME.drop()_**

Example

First check the collections that are already in the database mydb.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-7.PNG"></img>


Drop collection with the name "mycollection" should now be removed.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-8.PNG"></img>


Check the database once again for the list of collections.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-9.PNG"></img>


If the specified collection is successfully dropped, the drop() function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.


## 8. Utilizing the command insert() for adding documents

The insert () command from MongoDB permits users to add documents into collections. The example that follows explains how to perform this.

Step 1

Enter the “insert” command

Step 2

Add the appropriate Column Name and Column Value for the document that has to be generated within the "insert" command.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-10.PNG"></img>


Output


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-11.PNG"></img>



## 9. The array of objects in MongoDB using insert()

Multiple documents can be inserted into a collection at once with the "insert" command. To insert many documents in one go, use the code sample below.

**_Step 1_**

To store the collection of documents, define a JavaScript variable named "myEmployee."

**_Step 2_**

Add the necessary documents, together with the Field Names and Values, to the variable.

**_Step 3_**

The array of documents can be inserted into the collection using the insert command.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-12.PNG"></img>


Output


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-13.PNG"></img>


The result shows that the collection now includes those 3 documents.


## 10. Utilizing JSON for printing

The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format is basically a technique to store data in a structured, readable format. We'll utilize the JSON print feature in our next examples to see the results in a better style.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-14.PNG"></img>


Output


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-15.PNG"></img>



## 11. What do you mean by Primary key in MongoDB?

Each document in the collection could be separately recognized in MongoDB by utilizing the _id field as a primary key. A unique ObjectID value can be found in the _id column.

When adding documents to the collection, MongoDB will create an Object id field by default if you don't provide a column name along with the _id in the column name, as illustrated below.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-16.PNG"></img>


The ObjectId for every item in a collection is visible whenever we ask for the documents in the collection.

One must clearly indicate this when establishing the collection if you would like to make sure MongoDB does not generate the _id Field when the collection is formed and if you wish to specify their own id as the _id of the collection.

An id field has to have _id in its title when it is created specifically.


 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-17.PNG"></img>


Output

If the function is successfully executed, utilize the find command to show the documents present inside the collections.



 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/mongodb/DB-18.PNG"></img>


The result makes it very transparent that the collection's primary key is now the _id field that we defined when we first created it.


## 12. Summary

The two techniques for creating associations between documents in a MongoDB database were discussed in this tutorial.
