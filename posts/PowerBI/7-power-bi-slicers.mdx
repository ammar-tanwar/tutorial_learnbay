# Power BI Slicers

## 1. Overview

Some visual components known as Power BI slicers are crucial and beneficial in Power BI reports. After finishing this topic, everyone will have a strong understanding of how slicers operate, when to utilize them, how to design and format them, and many other essential aspects.

## 2. Scope of the tutorial  

This tutorial covers

- Definition of Power BI Slicers
- Requirement of Power BI Slicers
- How to execute a Slicer with the Power BI Desktop?
- Restrictions of Power BI Slicers

## 3. What do you mean by Power BI Slicers?

Slicers are a sort of on-canvas graphical filter in Power BI. With the help of the slicers, a person can sort as well as filter a complex report to see only the data they require. Like filters, slicers are displayed on the document as a visual and enable the user to choose values while reviewing the report. For instance, one can generate a slicer for years if you've got a sales analysis report. One can choose the year in which you would like to find the sales data from that slicer. The data for that particular year will automatically be displayed in the report's graphics.

The visuals displayed in the red box in the report's image below are a slicer. District managers' names are included there. One can sort the data by district monthly sales by choosing the managers' names from the slicer.

## 4. Requirement of the utilization of Power BI Slicer  

When you want to execute one or multiple tasks listed below, you can utilize a slicer in Power BI.

- By adding filters to the report canvas, users can quickly access critical and commonly utilized filters.
- By positioning the slicer exactly next to critical graphs and charts, one can view a focused report.
- Instead of accessing the filters drop-down list, users can quickly access all the filters that are currently utilized on the report.
- To display unnecessary, hidden, or little utilized columns while keeping them accessible for viewers in case they have to utilize them for analysis

## 5. How to execute a Slicer with the Power BI Desktop? 

Step 1: Launch the Power BI Desktop app. Open a preexisting report or begin a new report creation on the blank canvas.

Choose the Slicer icon from the Visualizations window. This will display a blank Slicer template on the browser.

Step 2: Dropping a field to the Values column by dragging it there from the Fields section(as shown by the red arrow)

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-3.png"></img>

As you can notice, the column District Managers has been added. District managers are included in a slicer that is created.

Step 3: By dragging the corners of this slicer element or positioning it wherever on the canvas, one can alter its size and location. Click the paint roller symbol to format the slicer.

### Date Slicer  


When we include a date element as the slicer value, a date slicer is generated. There will be two buttons at either end of a sliding bar on the date slicer. To modify the range, move these buttons forward or backward. The default setting for the range is from the old to the latest date.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-5.png"></img>

A calendar layout of the selected date is available by selecting it.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-6.png"></img>

From the drop-down menu, one can alter the type of date slicer. There are alternatives like Before, Between, List, After, Dropdown, and Relative that one would choose from. The sort of date slicer you employ will depend on its planned application.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-7.png"></img>

The image of a date slicer with a dropdown menu is provided below.

### Numeric Range Slicer 
 

When you utilize a numeric field to generate a slicer, a numeric range slicer is formed, similar to the date slicer.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-9.png"></img>

The slicer helps distribute the range among the two extremes, lower and higher. One can modify the field by dragging the ends forward as well as backward. Depending on the specific range you have selected on the slicer bar, all other visualizations on the report will modify.

### Sync Slicers


A slicer that we generate on one report page can be synced with the graphics on all the other report pages. As a result, regardless of the report's page, each graphic will react to any selections or adjustments made on the slicer.

Navigate to the View tab to select the sync feature. There, select the Sync Slicers option and check the box.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-11.png"></img>

On the right, a new SYNC SLICERS window will be displayed. The names of the report's pages will be listed there. One can select the boxes that appear in front of you. One could enable the slicer on certain pages by selecting the boxes in the eye icon column. Moreover, users only sync the results of slicer selections made on that page by clicking the boxes within the refresh icon column.

### Formatting the Slicer

 

For the slicer visual, Power BI Desktop offers a wide range of formatting possibilities. Click the paint roller Format icon to view the formatting option. Many formatting features, including Selection controls, Items, Slicer header, background, Title, and Border, are available in the format tab. Sections within each of these tabs include extra features.

Users have designed the slicer in a direct manner, as one can see in the screenshot below.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-14.png"></img>

One could modify the slicer items' vertical and horizontal orientation from the General tab.

This is what a horizontal slicer looks like.

The sort of item selection could be selected from the Selection controls tab. The slicer elements can be specified in one of three ways: single-select, multi-select, or select all.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-17.png"></img>

The text as well as the background color of the header could be set from the Slicer header tab. One might also choose the text's font, size, and outline type.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbs-18.png"></img>

One could change each slicer item's font color, text size, outline type, background, and font type from the Items tab.

## 6. Restrictions of Power BI Slicer

- Input fields are not supported by Power BI slicers.
- A slicer cannot be pinned to a dashboard.
- In a Power BI report, slicers do not enable drill-down.
- In Power BI slicers, there is no provision for visual-level filters.
- The information about the time zone is missing from the data models that were imported into Power BI and utilized in slicers. Although, Power BI Desktop's Query Editor allows users to modify a particular time zone to UTC.
- The numeric range slicers filter the data at the row level rather than dealing with aggregated values.
- Measures are not supported or utilized by the slicers.
- The numeric range slicers are only available in Power BI Desktop; Power BI Service is not suitable with it.

## 7. Summary

The Power BI slicers tutorial comes to an end. We hope that this information will enable you to utilize Power BI to start creating slicers based on your own reports.
