# Power BI - Components

## Overview

Microsoft's Power BI is a combination of several types of services for managing analytics and data mining. To enable Power BI to operate as a whole, these services each have a particular function and interact with one another. We will find more regarding all the **Power BI components** or services, with their functions, in this tutorial

## Scope of the tutorial  

This tutorial will cover

- Power Query
- Power View
- Power Pivot
- Power Q&A
- Power Map
- Power BI Mobile App
- Power BI Desktop
- Power BI Website

## Power Query

Power Query is a critical part of Power BI. One can either utilize this as part of Power BI Desktop or add it to your Excel spreadsheet. With the assistance of Power Query, one can delete information from several databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and other databases, as well as extract information from a variety of databases. Data could also be accessed from documents like Excel files, text, or CSV format.

Power BI provides a sophisticated GUI that enables users to perform any necessary data transformations and applications, like changing the date and time, adding columns, modifying the categories and content and many other options. It utilizes Power Query M Formula Language as the code beneath it, allowing it even more powerful than a GUI. The Power Query M Formula Language of the Power BI component is indeed case-sensitive and suited for creating extremely versatile data mashup queries. Power Query M Formula Language is available to Power BI Desktop and Power Query. It includes several features that a GUI cannot access.

## Power View  

The primary data visualization feature of Power BI is called Power View. It is a dynamic element that relates to sources of data and receives information for data analysis. The Power View lists provide a wide variety of visualization patterns. Each graphical component or even the entire study can have its data filtered utilizing Power View. When slicers are utilized, data could be sliced and diced more effectively.

In interactive reports, the user could opt to highlight a particular portion of the data or other Power View components to make them communicate with each other.

## Power Pivot  

A data modeling, as well as a calculation engine, is known as Power Pivot. Both basic and complicated data sets are modeled using it. One might define or build relationships between various tables with Power Pivot, as well as calculate data that can be displayed in Pivot tables. It provides users with many opportunities to work on the design.

All calculations are carried out in the highly functional language of Data Analysis Expression (DAX), the language which is utilized by Power BI Pivot. Hence we can say Power Pivot is one of the most powerful power BI components.

## Power Map   

Geospatial data is presented in 3D utilizing Power Map. The visualization acquires another dimension immediately as it renders in 3D mode. One parameter in Power Map can be the 3D column length, and another parameter could be the heatmap view. According to the location, the data could have been underlined. A country, state, city, or street address are all illustrations of regional places.

Power Map includes Bing Maps depending on geographic longitude or latitude or country, city, state, or street address information to generate the best representation.

## Power Q & A   

The data model's questions and answers are provided by Power BI Q&A, which utilizes a common language. After generating the data model and modifying it on the Power BI portal, users can question any issues and receive a response. For the best possible question-answering abilities, there are several shortcuts and tips for building the model. When it relates to data visualization, Power Q&A interacts with Power View so that users might ask questions like "How many customers are there per state?" and receive answers from Power Q&A in the form of a satellite view with numbers displayed in bubbles.

## Power BI Desktop  

The latest feature of the Power BI package is Power BI Desktop. Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power View function as integrated development tools. One can create complex queries, models, as well as reports using it. It is simple to upgrade the data analytics and business intelligence capabilities with Power BI Desktop.


## Power BI Mobile Apps   

Android, Windows, and iOS are the various mobile operating systems (OS) that support Power BI Mobile Apps. Users can access interactive reports as well as dashboards here on the Power BI website utilizing these applications. Even the smartphone application allows you to share them. It is possible to select a part of the reports, write a comment about it, and share it.

## Power BI Website

The posting of Power BI solutions is possible on the Power BI website. Power BI allows users to generate dashboards for the reports that you can then share with everyone. The Power BI website also allows users to instantly generate reports. With Power BI Website, users can slice and dice data online utilizing a web browser without the need for any extra functionality.

## Summary 

Eight Power BI components were covered in this tutorial. A company can utilize Microsoft Power BI's software, tools, and services to examine complex data and provide graphical solutions from it.
