# Power BI - Table and DAX

## Overview   

A grid featuring linked data organized systematically in rows and columns, a Power BI table is nothing more than that. The row totals and heading are both included in the Power BI Table. The Power BI functional language uses DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), a collection of functions, operations, and constants, to handle typical computation and data analysis problems.

## Scope of the tutorial   

This tutorial covers

- Definition of Power BI Table
- Definition of DAX
- Key features of DAX

## What is meant by Power BI Table?   

A Power BI table is just a grid that includes related data structured logically in rows and columns. The Power BI Table contains the header and row totals. The quantitative comparison works very nicely with a Power BI Table if you need to compare various numbers for a single category.

The Power BI Table is the best tool for examining and comparing accurate figures and detailed data in Power BI, as well as for tabulating data and showing numerical information for categories. A Power BI fresh table could be created utilizing a variety of DX functions, and an existing table can also be modified.

A table in Power BI is a structure that organizes similar data into lines and segments in a logical manner. It can also include headers as well as a total line. When evaluating a variety of features for a single category, tables with quantitative correlations perform well.

## What do you mean by DAX?  

A set of functions, operations, and constants are employed in the Power BI functional language known as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to address common calculation and data analysis issues. Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a formula expression language utilized by Power Pivot in Excel, Power BI, and Analysis Services. To perform complex calculations as well as queries on data in associated tables and columns, DAX formulas are included in tabular data models as operators, values, and functions.

By incorporating functions like Data Importing, Data Visualization, and Manipulation, working with DAX enhances the user experience. Standard reports can be produced with only a basic understanding of dashboards, but complicated and informative reports need DAX. The different commands and metrics can be utilized with the DAX syntax assist to produce reports that are extremely discriminating and intuitive.

Working with relational data in Power BI Desktop involves the usage of the formula language DAX. With more than 200 operators, functions and structures included in the DAX library, users have a lot of flexibility when it comes to writing formulas that calculate outputs for nearly any Data Analysis activity. Calculated tables are better than on-the-fly calculations or queries for intermediate calculations as well as data that you wish to maintain in the model. For instance, you might use a union or cross-join to combine two tables.

In DAX, several functions like as ADDCOLUMNS, CURRENTGROUP, DATATABLE, CROSSJOIN, EXCEPT, DISTINCT table, FILTERS, Table Constructor, VALUES, UNION, etc. either produce a table or modify an existing one.

More frequently, tables are generated by importing data into the model from an external source of data. On the other hand, calculated tables enable users to develop new tables using information that has been already entered into the database. Just specify the values of the table using a DAX formula as compared to querying and inserting data into the columns of a new table from a data source.

## Key Features of DAX     

### Excel formulas that provide standard functionality

Many people are familiar with VLOOKUP, SUM, and SUMIF as well as other Excel formulas. Similar formulas and more flexibility for all sorts of calculations are offered by DAX in Power BI. But Power BI utilizes tables as well as columns, whereas Excel formulas work with cells.

### Simplicity

The DAX techniques and ideas have a learning curve, but they are manageable, and after a short while, one will start to recognize a structure and logic. Once you've mastered these core ideas, it's really easy.

### Deals with Business Issues     

There is a great probability that DAX will resolve any data issues that encounter in Power BI. You could execute a broad variety of calculations using DAX, while you can always look for information in DAX utilizing a search tool or the Power BI community.

### Enhancing the data model  

When users understand the core ideas, including dimensional modeling as well as star schemas, the data model's consistency will substantially increase. Data modeling is commonly considered an art form.

### Time-intelligence Functions

The development of calculations using calendars and dates is assisted by these functions. Because of this, one can compare different time periods in a useful way.

### Calculated Columns     

You will eventually find yourself in a position where a field that's required is missing from your data. For instance, by combining text values or generating a numeric value from other data, calculated columns could be utilized to specify the value of a column.

### Utilizing DAX Table Constructor to generate a New Power BI Table

**Step 1**

Utilize Power BI Desktop to create a new file. Next, choose New Table from the Modeling tab.

**Step 2**

The following could be entered inside the table expression:

Sample Table = {1}

This will generate a table with the name Sample Table, a single column labeled "Value," and a single row with the value 1. The Value column's data type is instantly changed to Whole Number.

**Step 3**

If you'd like a Power BI fresh table having two or three rows, utilize the expression below:

Sample Table = {1,2,3,4}

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbta-3.png"></img>

**Step 4**

As you can see, the rows are separated by commas as well. However, to unite more columns into a single row, one must use parentheses, as displayed below:

Sample Table = {(1,2,3,4)}

**Step 5**

To generate a Power BI new table with several rows and columns, utilize the following expression:

Sample Table = {(1,2),(3,4)}

As illustrated below, this generates a table with two rows and two columns, value1, and value2.

**Step 6**

Any value may be entered for each cell.

Sample Table = {

(1,"the first row",DATE(2019,1,1)),

(3,"the second row",Date(2020,5,12))

}

## Limitations of Utilizing DAX Table Constructor to generate New Power BI Tables   

- The contents of cells as well as rows could be anything they want when we utilize constructors. But each row must have the same amount of columns otherwise an error would display.
- The column names are always Value1, Value2, Value3, etc., and users can modify those in the Table Constructor. Later, one can alter it by renaming it or by utilizing the SelectColumns procedure. Data types for columns are instantaneously defined before getting manually changed.

Due to these two disadvantages, it is recommended to utilize the DAX Datatable method since it offers users more solutions and versatility.

## Summary

DAX Table Constructor is utilized to generate a new Power BI table, and it also offers a quick overview of both Power BI and DAX. The table constructor is a fast and simple approach to generating tables in DAX if you must do so.
