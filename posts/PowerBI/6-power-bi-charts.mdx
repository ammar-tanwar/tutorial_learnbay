# Power BI Charts

## 1. Overview

Power BI Charts are dynamic, highly flexible, and interactive. They may update continuously as the fundamental data changes. To get ideas, one can modify the types of charts, add or delete data, and apply filters.

## 2. Scope of the tutorial  

This tutorial covers

- Definition of Power BI Charts
- Different types of Power BI Charts

## 3. What are charts in Power BI?

With the help of Power BI Charts, users can visualize a particular data collection from several different perspectives. These graphs show various insights and knowledge gained from a specific data collection. One can get reports from the charts that only contain one visualization or multiple pages of visualizations.

## 4. Various Charts that are frequently utilized in Power BI are as follows:-  

### Area Charts   

Line charts serve as the foundation for basic area charts, generally referred to as layered area charts. Colors are utilized to denote volume in the space between the axis and line, while lines represent trends over time.

Area charts illustrate the rate of shifts over time. They are indeed mostly utilized to demonstrate the overall worth of a tendency.

The area charts could also be utilized to illustrate individual series that are technically countable as a set.

For instance, An area chart can be utilized to illustrate the annual profit by plotting data that illustrates profit over time.

When to implement a simple area chart

Simple area charts are indeed a great option:

- To analyze as well as evaluate the quantity trend over a while.
- For a specific series that corresponds to a countable set.

### Bar/Column Charts    


The ideal method for analyzing a specific quantity across various categories is with a bar chart. Among all BI systems, bar charts are undoubtedly one among, perhaps the most popular data presentations.

The discrepancies between categories could be instantly identified, trends, as well as outliers, could be swiftly presented, and historical peaks and bad times can be easily viewed.

### Line Charts  

A line chart is indeed a typical type of visual representation that shows a collection of information elements related by a single direction. Continuous data sets are represented using it. Line charts are frequently utilized in forecasting time series and trend analysis of the stock market.

### Pie/Donut Charts

Pie charts are effective for offering other visuals more information. The value measured depends on the pie's angle. The pie chart could be provided with multiple colors to indicate the members in specific dimensions.

As far as it illustrates the relationship between parts to a whole, a doughnut chart is fairly equivalent to a pie chart. The only difference is that the middle is empty, which gives us room to see it more as a stacked bar chart that has wrapped itself around.

### Funnel Charts  

The funnel diagram assists in visualizing a multi-stage or multi-level process. It illustrates the elements that move in a linear fashion from one stage to another. Whenever there is a progressive flow between levels, such as in a sales procedure that begins with leads, progresses through the separation of possible sales as well as dead leads, and eventually terminates in the fulfillment of purchases, a funnel chart can be utilized.

### Key Influencers chart  

The key influencers visualization assists in the knowledge of the variables that affect a metric of interest. It evaluates the data, ranks all important variables, and lists them as the main determining factors.

### Combo Charts

A column chart, as well as a line chart, are merged to generate a combination chart. Merging the two charts as one allows users to compare the data more quickly. Be sure to pay close attention because combo charts might have one or two Y axes.

Combo charts are an excellent option:

- Whenever the same X-axis is being used by both a line chart as well as a column chart.
- To compare various measures with multiple value ranges.
- To visually illustrate the relationship between two measures.
- To determine if the goal set by one measure is achieved by another measure.
- To save space on the canvas.

### Gauge Charts  

A radial gauge chart displays one value that represents progression toward a goal and features a circular arc. The line represents the target value or goal (needle). The shade represents how close we are to achieving that goal. And within the arc, the value that indicates that achievement is displayed in bold. From the lowest value (leftmost value) to the highest value, all conceivable values are uniformly distributed along the arc (right-most value).

Radial gauges are an excellent alternative for

- Display progress toward a target.
- illustrate a percentile measure, such as a KPI.
- Describe the current state of one specific measure.
- Display data that can be swiftly viewed and understood.

### Maps 

In Power BI, maps are utilized to connect category and quantitative data to specific geographic regions. ArcGIS maps as well as Power BI work together to improve these maps with a simple presentation of dots on a map.

We have base maps, location sorts, symbol styles, themes as well as reference layers as possibilities, and this results in attractive, interesting map graphics. A better understanding of your data is conveyed by combining authoritative data layers with geographical analysis, such as census data.

### ArcGIS map   

ArcGIS maps as well as Power BI work together to take mapping beyond the simple representation of dots on a map. Attractive and interesting map visuals are generated using the possibilities for base maps, location sorts, symbol styles, themes as well as reference layers. A better context of the facts in any graphic is conveyed by combining trustworthy data layers (including census data) on the map utilizing spatial analysis.

### Azure Map

The Azure Maps in Power BI visual relates to a cloud service located in Azure to receive location data, including map pictures as well as coordinates, which are utilized to build the map presentation. A wide range of data presentations for satellite information on top of a map is offered by the Azure Maps Power BI visual. Over 80% of organization data is considered to have a locational context. One can understand more about how this spatial context connects to and affects the business data utilizing the Azure Maps Power BI visual.

### Filled Map   

A filled map illustrates how a value's percentage fluctuates throughout a geographic region using shading, coloring, or patterns. Use shading that changes from lighter (less frequent/lower) to darkest (more frequent/higher) to quickly illustrate these comparable variations.

### Shape Map   
 
Shape maps utilize color to compare geographical locations. A shape map is unable to display the exact positions of data locations on a map. However, by providing each region a different color, it mainly serves to illustrate how areas on a map relate to one another.

## Summary

We have discussed the most frequently utilized Power BI Chart Types in this tutorial. When considering the data that has to be displayed, it is crucial to make a reasonable graphical selection.
