# Power BI Dashboard

## 1. Overview

A single sheet, known as a canvas, frequently is known as a Power BI dashboard and it utilizes visuals to communicate a story. A well-designed dashboard only includes the critical components of the topic because it can only fit on one sheet.

## 2. Scope of the tutorial  

- Definition of Power BI Dashboard
- Benefits of Power BI Dashboard
- Generating of Power BI Dashboard

## 3. What do you mean by Power BI Dashboard?  

Single-page Power BI dashboards, also known as canvas, are documents that utilize graphs to convey a message. The highlights of a topic are the only information on a well-designed dashboard.

The term "Power BI dashboard" relates to a one-page visualization containing several graphs and charts to communicate a story. Canvas is another term for this single-page dashboard presentation. The Power BI dashboard is indeed a function that is exclusive to the Power BI Service. Although a Power BI dashboard can only be the one-page long, it only includes the most critical elements of a story. On Power BI Desktop, users are unable to generate a dashboard.

Visualizations on a dashboard are produced using data, and every data is dependent on a single dataset. The dashboard's visual representations are referred to as tiles, as well as data designers lock these tiles to a dashboard.

## 4. Benefits of Power BI Dashboard   

- Users might evaluate reports and instantly observe all critical metrics with the assistance of a Power BI dashboard.
- Users might be able to generate visualizations from several datasets or reports utilizing a Power BI dashboard.
- Users might be able to generate visualizations from several datasets or reports utilizing a Power BI dashboard.
- Dashboards can be modified to fulfill the demands of each organization.
- Applications could include Power BI dashboards so that users have a seamless experience.
- A dashboard could also be quickly shared with other employees within the company.

## 5. In Power BI how to generate a dashboard?    

One of the greatest techniques to learn how well a Power BI dashboard operates is to generate reports based on Power BI Desktop and transfer them to Power BI Service.

Throughout this presentation, we'll be working with the sales dataset that details product sales across the US. The dataset includes a variety of information on customers, such as customer names, orders as well as shipment dates, product categories, product names as well as subcategories, profit made, etc. An Example of a Superstore dataset is the conventional name for this data set. To compare sales as well as profits from each section, year, and quarter, we will analyze this dataset.

To begin, we'll make three different cards from which we may calculate the total sales, profit, as well as quantities sold. Clicking "card" in the visualization window on the right will generate an empty card.

The fields automatically update with the total number of sales for all products when you drag the sales column onto the fields. The text size and color of the sales value could both be changed on this card. One could also give this card a title. By dragging the appropriate columns onto fields, users can similarly construct two additional cards for total profit as well as total quantities sold.

The data will then be sliced depending on the "Order Date" column when we have added a slicer to our display. This will enable us to refine the data and identify it as necessary.

Let's say that one wishes to see and examine sales as well as profit over a given period of time. A line, as well as a stacked column chart, will be generated in order to accomplish this. Drag the "Order Date" field into the "Shared Axis" in the visualization panel, input "Sales" under "Column Values," then enter "Profit" into the "Line Values" for the line as well as the stacked column chart. The graph will then be created. Under the format tab, users can change the color of the bars and also the line.

The bars, as well as the lines in the above graph, stand in for sales as well as profit, respectively. According to the graph, 2018 had the greatest quantity of sales and profit.

To dig down into the data as well as examine the graph in regards to each quarter, month, as well as day, Power BI Desktop offers a great feature. When you select a particular chart, this choice is at the top.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-4.png"></img>

We can observe from the above visualization that November seemed to have the highest sales.

By choosing the "Format" button and turning on the data labels, one can also add labels to the graph.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-5.png"></img>

Selecting "Clustered Column Chart" from the Visualizations option. On the axis, including the "Year" column. Add the "Sales" columns to "Value" then take the "Quarter" columns from under "Legend."

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-6.png"></img>

The above graph illustrates that every year, the first quarter had the minimum sales figures whereas the fourth quarter regularly had the maximum sales. To create the graph more visually pleasing, users also get the option of changing the colors.

Let's now examine the sales data for each US state. We'll utilize a filled map to do this. A filled map can be picked from the visualization panel. Add a field for "State" under "Location." Column "Sales" must be moved to "Tooltips." Select "Data Colors" from the "Format" menu to modify the colors. Choose the conditional formatting feature, then add the desired color range.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-7.png"></img>

Our color scheme has been designed for the minimum, intermediate, and maximum sales values. The minimum sales were recorded in the states highlighted in green. Sales were maximum in California, Texas, as well as New York, the states highlighted in orange or red. Likewise, users can create a map to view the revenue as well as the number of units sold in each state.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-8.png"></img>

The consumer category had the maximum volume of sales as well as profit, whereas the home office sector had the minimum sales, according to the donut chart above. To make the visualization more attractive, one can reformat it to your preferences.

The next step will be to create a pie chart, that will allow us to see the sale for each type of product. Add the "Profit" field under "Values" then move the "Category" field over to "Legend." On the "Tooltips" tab, drag the "Sales" column.

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-9.png"></img>

The department that produced the most revenue and profit was technology, whereas the area that produced the least was furniture. To modify the colors as well as perform any other modifications, utilize the "format" option.

To evaluate the revenue for each category across states, let us now construct a clustered bar chart. The visualizations panel's clustered bar chart should be selected. Simply place the "State" field on the axis, the "Category" field on the legend, and also the "Sales" column on the "Value."

 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/powerbi/pbd-10.png"></img>

We will now develop a dashboard and publish our entire sales data on Power BI Service.

On Power BI Desktop, save your reports. Next, select "Publish" from the menu by clicking the home option.

## 6. Summary   

Dashboards are an excellent way to maintain track of your organization, seek solutions, and quickly examine the most crucial statistics. A dashboard's visualizations could be generated from a simple fundamental data collection or several, as well as a unique report or many. Irrespective of how the data is kept, a dashboard integrates on-premises and cloud-based data to provide a consolidated view.

A dashboard is more significantly interactive and adaptable compared to a lovely picture. Even if the primary data is changed, the tiles are updated.
