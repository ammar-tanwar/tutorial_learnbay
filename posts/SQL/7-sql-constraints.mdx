## **Overview**

SQL constraints are a group of standards utilized on tables in relational databases to restrict the types of data that could be inserted, altered, or deleted from those tables. In order to ensure the data's integrity and consistency recorded in the table, this process is done.

## **Scope of the tutorial**  
This tutorial covers

- Defining SQL Constraints
- Different categories of SQL Constraints

## **What are constraints in SQL?**

Constraints are the guidelines that a table's data columns must follow. These are employed to restrict the sort of data that could be entered into the table. This assures the database's information accuracy and durability. When inserting, deleting, and updating information into tables, constraints are employed to maintain data integrity. After the constraint is set up, any database activity that does not adhere to the restrictions set forth by the constraint is terminated.

## **Different categories of SQL Constraints**

SQL constraints could be applied to either columns or tables. With the exception of the check constraints, column-level constraints only apply to individual columns in a table. The column that they read is referred to. The names are determined by the table-level limitations of the relevant columns.

The below are frequently utilized SQL constraints:

- Primary Key
- Foreign Key
- Unique Constraint
- Not Null Constraint
- Default Constraint

### **The Primary Key**  


A field known as a primary key uniquely identifies every row or record in a database table.

In primary keys, distinct values should be present. There can't be NULL values in a primary key column.

There could only be one primary key per table, which may consist of one or more fields. A 'main key' that comprises many fields is referred to as a composite key.

Example

|
 ALTER TABLE SALES
 ADD CONSTRAINT pkID PRIMARY KEY (ID);

 ALTER TABLE SALES
 DROP CONSTRAINT pkID; |
| --- |

### **The Foreign Key**  

A relational database's foreign key constraint is utilized to stop operations from terminating the relationships between tables. A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or combination of columns) inside one table that refers to a 'PRIMARY KEY' of another table.

The table that is being referenced and holds the PRIMARY KEY is referred to as the parent table, and the one that contains the FOREIGN KEY is referred to as the child table.

### **The Unique Constraints**

A column's cell value cannot be replicated across the whole table, according to the UNIQUE constraint. This indicates that every row in the column of the table must be unique and avoid repetition. A column or collection of columns' uniqueness is assured by the UNIQUE & PRIMARY KEY criteria. The table's UNIQUE requirement can be set either at the time of creation or at a future point using an alter clause.

### **The NOT NULL Constraint**  

The NOT NULL constraint states that there can never be a blank cell value in any row throughout the column. This condition is frequently utilized in columns that contain data that are necessary to identify and retrieve data from a database.

Example

| CREATE TABLE SALES(
 ID INT NOT NULL,
 EID VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
 AGE INT NOT NULL,
 ADDRESS CHAR (25),
 SALARY DECIMAL (8, 2)
 );

 ALTER TABLE SALES
 ALTER COLUMN SALARY DECIMAL (8, 2) NOT NULL; |
| --- |

### **The DEFAULT Constraint**  

When any record in a specific column is left empty, the DEFAULT constraint can be utilized to provide a default value that must be provided. The default value would just be added to all new records in the missing value.

Example

<img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/sql/sql-cons-5.png"></img>

|
 ALTER TABLE SALES
 ADD CONSTRAINT DSAL DEFAULT 5000.00 FOR SALARY;

 ALTER TABLE SALES
 DROP CONSTRAINT DSAL; |
| --- |

### **The INDEX Constraint**  

In a relational database, indexes are defined on tables utilizing the INDEX constraint. With so many rows available in each table and the possibility for very large tables within relational databases, information extraction through SQL may potentially be a highly time-consuming procedure. The efficiency of retrieval operations may be significantly enhanced by building an index. The indexes are only utilized by the SQL engine to boost up searches and queries that the users cannot view them.

Setting up an INDEX Constraint

| CREATE INDEX idx\_id
 ON Sales (Sale\_Id); |
| --- |

Setting up a UNIQUEINDEX Constraint

| CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx\_id
 ON Sales (Sale\_Id); |
| --- |

Dropping an INDEX constraint

| ALTER TABLE Sales
 DROP INDEX idx\_id; |
| --- |

### **The CHECK Constraint**  

All the entries in a specific column must follow specified criteria, and this is when the CHECK constraint steps in. This constraint is typically utilized to establish business logic on data in a column, preventing the entry of incorrect data.

## **Summary**

Constraints refer to the limitations placed on a table's content columns. It is possible at both the column level and the table level. Utilizing the CREATE TABLE statement, constraints could be provided when a table is created. Users can also add constraints using the ALTER TABLE command after the table has already been set up.
