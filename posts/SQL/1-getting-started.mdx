## **Overview**

A language used to manage relational databases is known as a structured query language (SQL). For the purpose of storing, retrieving, and modifying information stored inside a relational database, among other things, SQL is frequently used in combination with relational databases.

## **Scope of the tutorial**

This tutorial covers

- Definition of SQL
- Why SQL?
- Benefits and disadvantages of SQL

## **Definition of SQL**   

An aspect of computer language utilized to preserve, extract, and modify data within relational databases is called a structured query language. In relational database systems, SQL is the primary language utilized. All Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), including MySQL, My SQL Server, MS Access, and Oracle utilizes SQL as their standard database language.

## **What is a database?**   

A database is a group of data that has been put in place so that it can be conveniently and effectively accessed. Database management systems are employed to handle such databases, sometimes known as DBMS.

## **Types of the database**

The two most common types of databases are, generally, as follows:

- Non-Relational
- Relational

### **Non-Relational Database(Non-RDBMS)**  

As a Non-RDBMS, data is typically stored in key-value pairs. They contain an unstructured dataset. The Non-RDBMS databases include Redis, MongoDB, and Amazon DynamoDB.

### **Relational Database Management System(RDBMS)**

Relational databases are managed via RDBMS. MySQL, My SQL Server, MS Access, and Oracle are all supported. SQL is utilized by the RDBMS to query the database.

## **Why SQL?**   

- Create the database and its table structures.
- Performing basic data management activities (add, delete and modify).
- Execute complex queries to transform raw data into valuable data.

## **What functions does SQL have?**

- SQL is capable of executing queries against databases.
- From a database, SQL may obtain information.
- A database can have records inserted using SQL.
- A database can be updated using SQL.
- A database may have records that can be removed using SQL.
- Create fresh databases using SQL.
- In a database, SQL could create new tables.
- SQL has the ability to establish stored procedures in databases.
- A database can include views created via SQL.
- Tables, procedures, and views can all have permissions defined via SQL.

## **Benefits of SQL**   
- SQL does not need a bunch of code to control database systems. The database can be conveniently accessed and managed by following simple SQL syntactic principles. The simple & basic rules of SQL make it user-friendly.
- A lot of data from the database is being quickly and efficiently accessed using SQL queries. The insertion, deletion, and updating of data are all completed more promptly.
- The well-known ISO and ANSI standards are referred to by SQL, which offers a uniform platform to all of its clients globally.
- Platform Independent: Users of desktops, laptops, tablets, and even smartphones may utilize the structured query language with comfort. It can also be utilized with other programs depending on the user's needs.
- The SQL language is informative to study and gain knowledge. We can communicate with the database using this language since it is an easy query language. This language is also used to get answers to complicated questions swiftly.
- With the assistance of the SQL language, it is also feasible to create different perspectives of a database structure for many database users.

## **Disadvantages of SQL** 

- Costs of operation are excessive for some SQL versions. Some programmers are unable to use the Structured Query Language due to this issue.
- Its complex user interface, which makes it difficult for SQL users to utilize and maintain, is another significant flaw of the structured query language.
- Business norms are hidden. Due to this, the database cannot be fully controlled by the users and data specialists that use this query language.

## **Summary**

An aspect of computer language utilized to preserve, extract, and modify data within relational databases is called a structured query language. A database is a group of data that has been put in place so that it can be conveniently and effectively accessed.
