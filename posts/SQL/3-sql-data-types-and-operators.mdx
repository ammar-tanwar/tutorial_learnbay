## **Overview**

A feature called a "data type" describes the sort of information that an entity may store. The data inside a table column or variable is specified by its data type. It is an important and vital step in the design and layout of tables. A table with the wrong data types can cause a number of problems, including poor query optimization, speed problems, etc. It serves to display the type of data that could be saved in a database table.

## **Scope of the tutorial**     
This tutorial covers

- Definition of data types in SQL
- Categories of SQL

## **Datatypes in SQL**

A feature that identifies the kind of data in any entity is known as a SQL data type. Based on your requirements you can select the type of data for each column in the table. Every column, variable, and expression in SQL has an associated data type. The kind of value that can be kept in a table column is specified by SQL Data Types.

These categories could be used to categorize SQL data types in a comprehensive manner.

- Exact Numeric data types
- Date and time data types
- Character and string data types

## **Exact Numeric data types**

## **Date & Time Data Types**

## **What is an operator in SQL?**


An operator is a restricted word or character that is often used in the WHERE clause of a SQL statement to carry out an operation, such as a comparison or an arithmetic calculation. These operators serve as connectives to various statements and also define the conditions that are included in an SQL statement.

## **SQL Arithmetic operator**

Assume that variable "a" contains 15 and variable "b" contains 30.

## **SQL Comparison Operators**


Assume that variable "a" contains 15 and variable "b" contains 30.

## **Some of the important data types point to keep in mind**

- Hardly a few relational database vendors support all data types. For instance, the MySQL data type does not support CLOB, and the Oracle database does not support DATETIME. Therefore, be sure to verify whether the data types are supported or not while defining database architecture and writing SQL queries.
- Although not all types of data are listed here, these are the ones most often used. Some distributors of relational databases can have their own data types that haven't been included here. For example, the MySQL server contains the money and small money data types, but it isn't featured here since other well-known database competitors don't support it.
- You do not have to keep a record of the highest size restrictions that each supplier of relational databases has set for various data kinds. The idea is to be aware of the relevant data type to utilize in a given circumstance.

## **Summary**

We briefly glanced at SQL Server data types in this tutorial. For efficient storage, query optimization, and data recovery, users must be conscious of all of the different data types and select the adequate data type.
