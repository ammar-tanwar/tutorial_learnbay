# **Chapter 2: (f)**

# **SQL Functions**

<img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/SQL/SQL-fun-1.jpeg"></img>

## **Overview**

A series of SQL commands known as SQL functions perform a particular operation. Functions encourage the reusability of codes. One can develop a function to execute the same operation if you frequently had to write lengthy SQL queries to execute it. One can just call that function the next time rather than create a new SQL function.

## **Scope of the tutorial**  

This tutorial covers

- The Definition of a function in SQL
- Types of functions with examples

## **What is a function in SQL?**

Data operations are executed by the use of functions. The function is a specified formula that accepts one or more inputs, processes those arguments, and then generates the result. Several built-in functions in SQL are being utilized with strings, numerical data, etc.

The two types into which SQL functions belong are as follows:

- Aggregate Functions
- Scalar Functions

## **Aggregate SQL Functions**  

A single result is delivered after a set of inputs are been submitted to calculations using SQL's aggregate functions.

Some of the Aggregate functions are as follows:

- **SUM()** - This is used to provide the total value of a specified numeric column.

Syntax

| SELECT SUM(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example:

| SELECT SUM(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 237,000 |
| --- |

**Count()**

Provides the count of rows that is available in the table, either with or without conditions.

Syntax:

| SELECT COUNT(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName
 WHERE Condition; |
| --- |

Example1

| SELECT COUNT(EMP\_ID)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 6 |
| --- |

Example2

| SELECT COUNT(EMP\_ID)
 FROM Employee
 WHERE Salary \>=40000.00; |
| --- |

Output

| 3 |
| --- |

**AVG()**

The average result of a numerical column is provided by this function.

Syntax

| SELECT AVG(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT AVG(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 39500.00 |
| --- |

**MIN()**

The output is delivered when a numeric column's minimum value is required.

Syntax

| SELECT MIN(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT MIN(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 27000 |
| --- |

**MAX()**

The output is delivered when a numeric column's maximum value is required.

Syntax

| SELECT MAX(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT MAX(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 55000 |
| --- |

**FIRST()**

The first item of the selected column is returned by this function.

Syntax

| SELECT FIRST(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT FIRST(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 50000 |
| --- |

**LAST()**

The last item of the selected column is returned by this function.

Syntax

| SELECT LAST(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT LAST(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 30000 |
| --- |

## **Scalar SQL Functions**  

A single output could be generated from an input value by utilizing the scalar functions in SQL.

**LCASE()**

It is utilized to transform a string column's values to lowercase characters.

Syntax

| SELECT LCASE(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT LCASE(EMP\_ID)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| sathya
 tejas
 tinku
 rittu
 rakesh
 milan |
| --- |

**UCASE()**

It is utilized to transform a string column's values to uppercase characters.

Syntax

| SELECT UCASE(ColumnName)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT UCASE(EMP\_ID)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| SATHYA
 TEJAS
 TINKU
 RITTU
 RAKESH
 MILAN |
| --- |

**LEN()**

It is used to obtain the given string length by this method.

Syntax

| SELECT LENGTH(String) AS SampleColumn; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT LENGTH("Rakesh") AS EMPNAMELEN; |
| --- |

Output

| 6 |
| --- |

**MID()**

Substrings can be extracted from columns with string data types using this method.

Syntax

| SELECT MID(ColumnName, Start, Length)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT MID(EMP\_Name, 2, 3)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| ath
 eja
 ink
 itt
 ake
 ila |
| --- |

**Round()**

Using this function, you could round a number off to the closest integer.

Syntax:

| SELECT ROUND(ColumnName, Decimals)
 FROM TableName; |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT ROUND(Salary)
 FROM Employee; |
| --- |

Output

| 50000
27000
40000
35000
55000
30000 |
| --- |

**NOW()**

It is used to get the time and date as of right now. The format of the returned date and time is "YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS."

Syntax

| SELECT NOW() |
| --- |

Example

| SELECT NOW() |
| --- |

OUTPUT

| 2022-10-1115:45:33 |
| --- |

**FORMAT()**

This function formats a field so that it will be presented appropriately.

Syntax

| FORMAT(InputValue, Format) |
| --- |

Example

| Write a query to present the number "5367802033"in the format "###-###-###"

 SELECT FORMAT(5367802033, "###-###-###"); |
| --- |

Output

| 536-780-203 |
| --- |

## **SQL STRING FUNCTIONS**   
**Substring()**

Depending on the length and start position values, a string's component.

Example

| Select SUBSTRING ('WORLD', 1,3) |
| --- |

Output

| WOR |
| --- |

**Replace()**

A string expression will be produced for a supplied string of information once all instances of the specified character have been replaced with the supplied character.

Example

| Select REPLACE('INDIA', 'I', 'K') |
| --- |

Output

| KNDKA |
| --- |

**REVERSE()**

For a provided string of information, a reverse string expression would be generated.

**STUFF()**

For a particular string of data, a string expression would be produced as the result of replacing every character up to the provided length with the desired character.

Example

| Select STUFF('ABCDEFGH', 2,4,'IJK') |
| --- |

Syntax

| DATEDIFF (datepart, startdate, enddate) |
| --- |

- DAY

Syntax
