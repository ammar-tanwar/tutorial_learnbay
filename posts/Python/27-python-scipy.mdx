## 1. Overview

To solve problems in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, one uses an open-source Python package called Python SciPy. Users can modify and view the data with the need of a number of advanced Python tools. SciPy is achieved by the Python NumPy extension.


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial covers



* Definition of Python SciPy
* Different ways to use SciPy functions


## 3. What is SciPy and why do we use it?

Mathematical algorithms and scientific questions are solved with the Python SciPy toolkit. It is a development of numerical Python (numpy), and it offers the user a wide variety of high-level instructions to change and inspect data.


## 4. Numpy vs. SciPy

Both are restricted to certain operations since they are used for mathematical analysis. Since Numpy utilizes data from an array and SciPy only supports numerical data, it is suitable for some fundamental processes like indexing, sorting, etc. Linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and other numerical techniques are solved using a variety of functions in Numpy, but the SciPy package includes the whole linear algebra module as well as several more numerical methods.


## 5. Subcategories in SciPy


<img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/python/Untitled.png"></img>


Importing the package in Python should be done before working on the mentioned functions.

Example


```
from scipy import special
```



## 6. Exponential and trigonometric functions

The SciPy Special Function package contains several functions that may be used to estimate exponents and resolve trigonometric problems.

Example


```
from scipy import special
val = special.exp10(6)
print(val)
 
val2 = special.exp2(6)
print(val2)
 
val3 = special.sindg(60)
print(val3)
 
val4 = special.cosdg(45)
print(val4)

Output
1000000.0
64.0
0.8660254037844387
0.7071067811865475
```


**_Note: There are only a few SciPy methods in the example above._**


## 7. Interpolation Function

In numerical analysis, interpolation is the technique of inserting new data points into an existing collection of known data points. The SciPy library's single and multi-dimensional interpolation classes, spline methods, etc. may be found in the subpackage scipy.interpolate.


### **Univariate Interpolation**

Univariate interpolation, in general, is the study of finding the curve that best fits a collection of 2-D data points.

Example


```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import interpolate
x = np.arange(4, 20)
y = np.exp(x/5.0)
f = interpolate.interp1d(x, y)
x1 = np.arange(8, 16)
y1 = f(x1)   # use interpolation function returned by `interp1d`
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', x1, y1, '--')
plt.title("Univariate Interpolation", fontsize = 25)
plt.show()

Output
```

### **Multivariate Interpolation**

It is the term for this technique of interpolating functions with several variables (sometimes known as spatial interpolation).

Example


```
from scipy import interpolate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.arange(0,25)
y = np.arange(25,35)
x1, y1 = np.meshgrid(x, y)
z = np.tan(x1+y1)
f = interpolate.interp2d(x, y, z, kind='cubic')
x2 = np.arange(1,7)
y2 = np.arange(15,20)
z2 = f(x2, y2)
plt.plot(x, z[0, :], 'ro-', x2, z2[0, :], '--')
plt.title("Multivariate Interpolation", fontsize = 25)
plt.show()

Output
```

## 8. Waveforms

There are several functions available in the scipy.signal subpackage that may be used to create waveforms. Chirp is one of these capabilities. A frequency-swept cosine generation is used in this function.

Example


```
from scipy.signal import chirp, spectrogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
t = np.linspace(5, 15, 400)
w = chirp(t, f0=3, f1=2, t1=4, method='linear')
plt.plot(t, w)
plt.title("Linear Chirp", fontsize = 25)
plt.xlabel('time in sec)')
plt.show()

Output
```

## 9. Functions of Signal Processing

It is the study of analyzing, manipulating, and creating signals, such as audio, images, etc. Some of the SciPy functions allow you to construct, filter and interpolate 1D and 2D data.


### **Filtering**

It is a signal that eliminates unwanted components. Filtering that is ordered is done using the order filter function. This technique filters an array in a specific order.

Syntax


```
order_filter(o,domain,rank)
o = N-dimensional input array
domain = mask array having the same number of dimensions as 'o'
rank = Non-negative number that selects elements from the list after it has been sorted (0 is the smallest followed by 1...)
```


Example


```
from scipy import signal
x = np.arange(75).reshape(15, 5)
domain = np.identity(5)
print(x,end='nn')
print(signal.order_filter(x, domain, 1))


```

## 10. Linear Algebra

Using matrices as well as linear algebra, vector spaces is the study of linear equations. Since SciPy is based on the ATLAS LAPACK and BLAS libraries, it is exceptionally rapid to solve problems involving linear algebra. Numpy is slower than scipy.linalg, which is also faster. If ATLAS LAPACK and BLAS support are not used, linalg will result.

Example


```
from scipy import linalg
import numpy as np
val = np.array([[10,25], [40,35]])
val1 = linalg.inv(val)
print(val1)

Output
[[-0.05384615  0.03846154]
 [ 0.06153846 -0.01538462]]
```



## 11. Finding the determinant of a square matrix

A square matrix's components can be used to calculate the determinant, a scalar number that contains certain characteristics of the linear transformation the matrix describes. The symbols for the determinant of a matrix A are det, det A, or |A|. This is calculated in SciPy using the det() function. It receives an input matrix and outputs a scalar value.

Example


```
#importing the packages scipy and numpy
from scipy import linalg
import numpy as np
  
#the numpy array is declared
val = np.array([[2,3,9],[8,1,7],[3,7,9]])
#The values are transmitted to the det function.
x = linalg.det(val)
  
#printing the output
print('Determinant of \n{} \n is {}'.format(val,x))

Output
Determinant of 
[[2 3 9]
 [8 1 7]
 [3 7 9]] 
 is 244.0
```



## 12. Functions of Multidimensional Image Processing

The fundamental concept of image processing is to extract information from a picture or transform it into a better version of itself through the application of operations. The scipy.ndimage package contains several methods for processing and analyzing pictures that may be used with arrays of any dimension.


## 13. Correlation and convolution

SciPy offers several features that make image correlation and convolution simpler.



* The function "correlate1d" allows for the calculation of 1D correlation along the provided axis.
* The function "correlate" provides a multidimensional correlation of any array with the supplied kernel.
* The function "convolve1d" allows for the calculation of 1D convolution along the designated axis.
* The function "convolve" permits multidimensional convolution of any array specified with the supplied kernel.

Example


```
from scipy.ndimage import correlate1d
correlate1d([4,6,7,2,9,3,5,6], weights=[1,5])

Output
array([24, 34, 41, 17, 47, 24, 28, 35])
```



## 14. Summary

Basically, SciPy is used for scientific computations rather than ordinary math. We focused on the extensive range of functions the SciPy library offers.
