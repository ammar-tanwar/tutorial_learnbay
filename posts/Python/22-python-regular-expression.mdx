# **Chapter 8**


# **Python Regular Expression (RegEx)**



<img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/python/Python+Regular+Expression+(RegEx).jpg"></img>



## 1. Overview

Python regular expressions (RegEx) are a quite useful feature.  It can be dealt with using the ‘re’ module in Python. An expression that specifies a search pattern is known as a regular expression (RegEx).


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial will cover



* Definition of regular expression in python
* Different methods in Python regular expression


## 3. What do you mean by Regular Expression in python?

It is used to define a pattern that helps us match, locate, and replace a string from a text is called a regex or regular expression. RegEx can be utilized to determine whether a string includes a given search pattern or not. It is a module in Python.

To use a regex import the library ‘re’.

**_import re_**

Example


import re
text='I have a blue car'		# wherever you have blue just convert it into green
pat=r'blue'
res=re.sub(pat,'green',text)
print(res)
Output
I have a green car.



## 4. Different methods in regular expression


## 5. The match() Function



* It matches the given pattern at the beginning of the string
* If the pattern matches, it returns the match object.
* If the pattern doesn't match, it returns None
* To extract the matched values from the match object we use group()

Syntax- re.match(pattern,text)

**_pattern_** - The regular expression needs to match.

**_text_** - This is the string that would be examined for matches to the pattern at its beginning.

r‘pattern’ # r - raw string

(.)- Matches all characters except new lines

\d- Matches all digits 0-9

\D- Matches all non-digits (0-9)

\w- Matches all alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _)

\W- Matches all non-alphanumeric characters

\s- Matches all whitespaces (space,\t,\n)

\S- Matches all non-whitespace characters

\b- Matches a word boundary (\bword) (word\b) (\bword\b)

\B- Matches a noon boundary

^-  Matches a pattern from the beginning of a string

$-  Matches a pattern from the end of a string

[A-Z]- Matches any character from A-Z

[a-z]- Matches any character from a-z

[^Ab5]- Matches all characters except the ones not in square brackets. It means it will exclude Ab5

|- Either or

(com|net)- Matches the exact group of characters (It will match a pattern that has com and net)

Example


import re
mat = "Many houses are located in Bangalore"
matchObj = re.match(r'(.*) are (.*?) .*', mat, re.M|re.I)
if matchObj:
    print ("matchObj.group() : ", matchObj.group())
    print ("matchObj.group(1) : ", matchObj.group(1))
    print ("matchObj.group(2) : ", matchObj.group(2))
else:
    print ("No match!!")

Output
matchObj.group() :  Many houses are located in Bangalore
matchObj.group(1) :  Many houses
matchObj.group(2) :  located



## 6. The search() function



* It matches the first occurrence of the pattern and returns a match object.
* If the pattern is not found then it returns None

Example


text="The largest continent in the world is Asia and Asia has many countries"
pattern=r'Asia'

res=re.search(pattern,text)
print(res)
print(res.group())
print(res.span())
print(res.start())
print(res.end())

Output
<re.Match object; span=(38, 42), match='Asia'>
Asia
(38, 42)
38
42



## 7. The findall() function



* It matches all the occurrences of the given pattern and returns a list
* If the pattern is not found then it returns an empty list

Example


text="The largest continent in the world is Asia and Asia has many countries"
pattern=r'Asia'

res=re.findall(pattern,text)
print(res)
Output
['Asia', 'Asia']


Example2


# Match all the values that start with a number and after that have an alphabet
text="a1 2b 4c d5" 
pattern=r'[0-9]\w'

res=re.findall(pattern,text)
print(res)

Output
['2b', '4c']



## 8. The finditer() function



* It returns an iterator object.
* It matches all the occurrences of the pattern in the text
* Every element in the iterator object is a match object

Example


text="India is a colorful country. India is one of the largest countries in Asia"
pattern=r'India'
res=re.finditer(pattern,text)
print(res)
print()

for i in res:
    print(i)
    print(type(i))
    print(i.group())
    print(i.span())
    print(i.start())
    print(i.end())
    print('\n')

Output
<callable_iterator object at 0x00000139AD3D0E80>

<re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='India'>
<class 're.Match'>
India
(0, 5)
0
5

<re.Match object; span=(29, 34), match='India'>
<class 're.Match'>
India
(29, 34)
29
34


Example 2


text="India is a colorful country. India is one of the largest countries in Asia"
pattern=r'India'
res=re.findall(pattern,text)
print(res)

Output
['India', 'India']



## 9. re.compile()

Regular expressions are built into template objects, which provide methods for different activities like checking for pattern matches or changing strings.

Example


# compile() creates the regular expression
# characters class [a-e],
# which is equivalent to [abcde].
# string with class [abcde] will match
# 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'.
p = re.compile('[a-e]')
 
# findall() searches for the RegEx
# and, upon finding, return a list
print(p.findall("Hello All Welcome to Learnbay Datascience Course"))

Output
['e', 'e', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'e', 'e']

Note: A in All is not displayed as it is case sensitive



## 10. Summary

We covered Python regular expressions in this tutorial. Through examples, you examined several Python RegEx methods and metacharacters.
