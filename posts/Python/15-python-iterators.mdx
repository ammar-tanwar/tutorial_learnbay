**Chapter 5(a)**


# **Python Iterators**


## 1. Overview

An object with a countable range of values is an iterator. An object that may be iterated upon, or traversed through all the values, is known as an iterator.


## 2. Scopes of this tutorial

This tutorial will cover



* Definition of an iterator in python
* Methods in an iterator


## 3. What do you mean by an iterator in python?

In Python, an object with a countable number of iterable elements is known as an iterator. In other words, Iterators are objects that let you iterate through every element in a collection and return each element one at a time. Iterators technically refer to objects that implement the iterator protocol in Python, which consists of the functions __iter__() and __next__ ().

Example


# A built-in Python iterator is shown here.
# Anything that can be iterated serves as a value
val = 'Learnbay python course'
obj = iter(val)
 
while True:
    try:
 
        # Calling next between iterations
        item = next(obj)
        print(item)
    except StopIteration:
 
        # When an iteration is complete,
         an exception will occur.
        break

Output
L
e
a
r
n
b
a
y
 
p
y
t
h
o
n
 
c
o
u
r
s
e


Example2


# some of the examples of built-in iterators
 
# Iteration of a list
print("Iteration of a list")
x = ["Python", "is", "data", "science", "course"]
for i in x:
    print(i)
     
# Iteration of a tuple
print("\nIteration of a tuple")
y = ("Python", "is", "data", "science", "course")
for i in y:
    print(i)
     
# Iteration of a String
print("\nIteration of a string")   
g = "Python is data science course"
for i in g :
    print(i)
     
# Iteration of a dictionary
print("\nIteration of a dictionary")  
d = dict()
d['hello'] = 23654
d['python'] = 25000
for i in d :
    print("%s  %d" %(i, d[i]))

Output
Iteration of a list
Python
is
data
science
course

Iteration of a tuple
Python
is
data
science
course

Iteration of a string

t
h

python  25000



## 4. Iterable and iterator

An object that can be iterated over is indeed iterable. When supplied to the iter() function, it creates an Iterator. Iterable objects include strings, sets, dictionaries, lists, and tuples. They can be transformed into an iterator because they are iterable containers.

Take note that while every iterable serves as an iterator, not all iterables are iterators. 

For instance,   a tuple is iterable but not an iterator. 

Using the function iter(), an iterator may be generated from an iterable. As a result, an iterator will be returned when this tuple is passed into an iter() method. In reality, this is allowed because an object's class has a technique called __iter__ that returns an iterator.

Implementing a for loop to automatically iterate is a more suitable method. We may iterate over every object which can yield an iterator with this, including lists, strings, files, and many more.

Example


my_list = [6, 27, 40, 63, 'Python']
for element in my_list:
    print(element)

Output
6
27
40
63
Python


The for loop is able to iterate automatically through the list, as you can see in the example above. In reality, any iterable may be iterated using the _for loop_. 


## 5. Methods that are specified in an iterator

There are two methods



* __iter__()
* __next__()


### **__iter__() function**

The real iterator object is returned by this function. For the for statements to work properly, both containers, as well as iterators, must be supported.


### **__next__() function**

The next item in the container is returned by this function. Raising the StopIteration exception when there is a lack of any further items.

Example1


# defining a iterable utilising a list
lst = [0, 1, 2]
# getting an iterator using iter()
iter1 = lst.__iter__()
#iert the item using __next__method
print(iter1.__next__())

Output
0


Example2


# defining a iterable utilising a string
string = "hello"
# to obtain an iterator, use iter()
iter5 = iter(string)
# iterate through it by utilizing next()
print(next(iter5))
print(next(iter5))
print(next(iter5))
print(next(iter5))
print(next(iter5))

Output
h
e
l
l
o



## 6. Utilising a while loop with a for loop to iterate an iterator

Why can't we utilise a while loop to ease our workload as we are continuously utilising the next() function? Moreover, we can utilize exception handling to deal with the error we receive when the iterator runs out of elements. Because of this, whenever the error "StopIteration" occurs, control is transferred to the except block, and the break statement is actually executed.

Example


# defining an iterable utilising a list
lst=[14,82,93,34,75,6,27,48,59,20]

# get an iterator using iter()
iter1=iter(lst)
while True:
    try:
        print(next(iter1)) # get the next item
    except StopIteration:
        # once the StopIteration is raised, break from loop
        break

Output
14
82
93
34
75
6
27
48
59
20



## 7. Indefinite python iterators

The item in an iterator object does not always need to be fixed. Iterators are limitless in number (which never ends). When working with these iterators, we must be cautious.

Example


class InfiniteIterator:
 
    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = 0
        return self
 
    def __next__(self):
        result = self.n * 3
        self.n += 1
        return result
 
multiplesOfThree = InfiniteIterator()
 
i = iter(multiplesOfThree)
 
print("Multiples of three are:")
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
print(next(i))

Output
Multiples of three are:
0
3
6
9
12
15
18
21
24
27



## 8. Summary

In this tutorial we have gone through iterators and its methods. Iterators are useful since they allow us to retain a lot of resources. As we can see, there is no array of integers stored when calculating multiples of three.
