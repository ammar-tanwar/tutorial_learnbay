 <img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/python/python+overview+main+banner.png"></img>


## 1. Overview

Python is interpreted high-level, object-oriented, and interactive programming language. It is designed for its readability as it is composed in English. It has very few syntactical when compared to other languages in programming.


## 2. Scopes of the tutorial

This tutorial will cover



* Introduction to Python
* Why use Python?
* Why learn Python?


## 3. Introduction to Python

It is when C, C++, and Java were not so user-friendly in the late 1980’s Guido Van Rossum made an effort to find Python. It was then brought to light in Feb 1991.


## 4. Why use Python?

It is so flexible that it is utilized in all technical fields namely Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Data Science, Scientific Calculation, Web Development, etc. Before learning Python the primary goal should be very clearly known. It includes various factors such as **_libraries, built-in functions, data structures, and modules_**. 



1. Motivational Factors

Let us now figure out some motivational factors that will help you learn python.



* Artificial intelligence - As we are moving towards digital technology this may be one of the key motivational factors 
* Data Analysing and Processing
* Robots/Sensors/Hardware
* Gaming Application
* Mobile and Desktop Applications

2. Syntax

It is very important that the syntax in python programming is very simple. As we saw earlier it utilizes very few syntactical and the output is instantaneous.



3. Compatibility with all major programming languages

    Python is been supportive of all operating systems. It can be run on various platforms.



## 5. Why learn python?

To be a Software professional, python becomes a must for the following reasons.



* Interpreted programming language - The output of the code will be displayed immediately as soon as it is executed.
* Interactive programming language - Simple English language is used
* Beginner’s programming language - User friendly
* It works on various platforms


## 6. Conclusion

Python is one of the most upcoming popular programming languages which is user-friendly and efficient while executing the program.
