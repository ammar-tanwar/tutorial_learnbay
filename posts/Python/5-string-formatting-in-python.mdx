## 1. Overview

As a programmer, it is essential to have an overall understanding of string formatting and its benefits. String formatting in Python is nothing but introducing a variable to the written source.

 


## 2. Scopes of this tutorial

This tutorial will cover


●      What is string formatting in Python?


●      Benefits of using the .format() method in Python

 


## 3. What does Python's string formatting mean?

String formatting is a potential that must be known inside out when it comes to coding expertise. Usually, a string has an easy flow of writing. It is the process of introducing a variable to the written source. It is a crucial component of a programming language. It includes modifying strings in basic text with user-defined values or phrases.

Curly braces '{}', sometimes known as "placeholders," are used in the String format method as "arguments" that can be held in various positions and according to an ordered keyword.

 


## 4. Benefits of using the .format() method in Python


●      Inserting variables based on index position


●      Inserting variables by assigning keywords


●      Duplicates can be avoided even if the same variable is used


●      Increasing and decreasing floating point is possible

 

Examples of string formatting in Python

 


●      **Index-based position**

 


```
print ('{2} {0} {1}'.format('you?', 'how', 'are'))
 
Output
How are you?
```


 


●      **Assigning keywords**

 


```
print('a: {a}, b: {b}, c: {c}'.format(a = 108, b = 'Sixty-Eight', c = 462.65))


Output
a: 108, b: Sixty-Eight, c: 462.65


```



●      **Assigning the same variable to avoid duplicate**

 


```
print('The first {w} was alright, but the {w} {w} was not correct.'.format(w = 'word'))
```


 


```
Output
The first word was alright, but the word word was not correct.
```


 


●      **Increase or decrease Floating points**

 


```
print("Floating point {0:.3f}".format(425.16408732))
```


 


```
Output
Floating point 425.164
```


 

Note: ‘f’ represents the floating point and ‘3’ represents the number of digits after the decimal.

 

The easiest and most efficient method for string formatting is using F-strings. String literal formatting is also another name for it. Here, the string is handled as a formatted string by using the literal 'f' at the beginning.

 


## 5. Summary

String formatting is a common operation, and the way it is displayed in f-strings makes it incredibly simple for everyone to use Python. Because it is so simple to create and maintain, the f-string is the most popular and widely used method for formatting strings. Therefore, using formatting strings is encouraged to simplify and improve coding skills.
