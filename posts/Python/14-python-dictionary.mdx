# Chapter 4: (h)


# Python Dictionary

 


## 1. Overview

A key and the corresponding value are both represented like a pair of values in a Python dictionary (key: value). Keys must belong to an immutable type; values may be of whatever data type and may repeat.

 


## 2. Scope of this tutorial

This tutorial covers


●      Python dictionary definition


●      Accessing Dictionary Elements in Different Ways

 


## 3. Definition of the Python Dictionary

The data that is wrapped in curly brackets with a key and value separated by a semi-colon(:) is referred to as a dictionary. A dictionary is implemented in Python as a data structure. Data values are kept in dictionaries as key-value pairs.

Example1


```
st_name = (101, 'Suresh', 'Ramesh', 'Veeresh')
st_id = ('LB101', 'LB102', 'LB103', 'LB104')
st_email = ['rakesh@gmail.com','suresh@yahoo.com', 'ramesh@hotmail.com', 'veeresh@gmail.com']

st_details = {'st_1':{'name':'Rakesh', 'id':'LB101', 'email':'rakesh@gmail.com'},
'st_2':{'name':'Suresh', 'id':'LB102', 'email':'suresh@yahoo.com'},
'st_3':{'name':'Ramesh', 'id':'LB103', 'email':'ramesh@hotmail.com'},
'st_4':{'name':'Veeresh', 'id':'LB104', 'email':'veeresh@gmail.com'}}

print(st_details['st_4']['id'])
print(list(st_details['st_2'].items())[1])

Output
LB104
('id', 'LB102')
```


Example2


```
car = { "brand": "Hyundai","model":"Getz","year": 2010,"year": 2022}
print(car)

Output
{'brand': 'Hyundai', 'model': 'Getz', 'year': 2022}
```


Here brand, model, and year are keys while Hyundai, Getz, 2010 and 2022 are values

**_Note 1: We can see that Example 2 assumes the year to be 2022. Python accepts the most recent modifications made to any value allocated to its key._**

**_Note 2: Duplicate key values are not accepted in dictionaries._**


## 4. Accessing Dictionary Elements in Different Ways

We may use the function below to obtain the data.



* Get Keys
* Get Values
* Get Items

Get Keys: The get() method returns the values associated with the object whose key is specified.

Example


```
car = { "brand": "Hyundai","model":"Getz","year": 2010,"year": 2022}
a=car.get("model")
print(a)

Output
Getz
```


Get values: Returns a list of all values found inside the dictionary that was specified. Values that are in reverse have been retained.

Example


```
salary = {"Dan":17000,"mike":45000,"juke": 82000}
out1 = salary.values()
print(sum(out1))

Output
144000
```


Get items: All dictionary keys and values are returned in a list by the items() method of the Python dictionary.

Example


```
out = {"name":'mike',"status":'married',"place":'Bangalore'}
items = out.items()
print(items)

Output
dict_items([('name', 'mike'), ('status', 'married'), ('place', 'Bangalore')])
```



## 5. Addition And Deletion of Elements in Dictionary

ERP can be modified to meet the constant turnover of resources in industries with high rates of growth by adding and removing components. Below is a description of how to obtain the updated data. The Dictionary's built-in update() method may be used to add the elements to the current data.

To remove data, use the built-in Python method pop().

Example


```
#Adding of elements
empl_det = {"zenk" : 19000,"marker":42000,"rodio":38000}
empl_det.update({"bendon":59500})
print(empl_det)

Output
{'zenk': 19000, 'marker': 42000, 'rodio': 38000, 'bendon': 59500}
```



```
#Deletion of elements
empl_det = {'zenk': 19000, 'marker': 42000, 'rodio': 38000, 'bendon': 59500}
empl_det.pop('zenk')
print(empl_det)

Output
{'marker': 42000, 'rodio': 38000, 'bendon': 59500}
```



## 6. Using a loop to find the key elements

Let's take a closer look at how to utilise Python's loop function to find keys, values, and items in dictionaries.

Example


```
empl={"Dept1":"Maths","Dept2":"Physics","Dept3":"Biology","Dept4": "Chemistry"}
for x in empl:
    print(x)

Output
Dept1
Dept2
Dept3
Dept4
```



## 7. Using a loop to access the values

The values() function can be used to return dictionary values.

Example:


```
empl={"Dept1":"Maths","Dept2":"Physics","Dept3":"Biology","Dept4": "Chemistry"}
for x in empl.values():
    print(x)

Output
Maths
Physics
Biology
Chemistry
```



## 8. Using a loop to access the items in dictionaries

The results of the Items identified in dictionaries are produced by Items loops.

Example:


```
empl={"Dept1":"Maths","Dept2":"Physics","Dept3":"Biology","Dept4": "Chemistry"}
for x in empl.items():
    print(x)

Output
('Dept1', 'Maths')
('Dept2', 'Physics')
('Dept3', 'Biology')
('Dept4', 'Chemistry')
```



## 9. Things to keep in mind



* In Python, dictionaries are one of the accessible composite data types.
* The information is kept as a key-value pair.
* Dictionary prevents using the same key value twice.
* The nature of Python's dictionary keys is immutability.
* Strings and integers can be used as dictionary keys, but lists are not possible. They also enhance dictionary reading. The nesting of two Python dictionaries is another feature.


## 10. Summary

A selection of the Python dictionaries that we will eventually need for all development work. They are adaptable and offer valuable capabilities for anything from the simple job of inserting a key-value combination to dictionary comprehension.
