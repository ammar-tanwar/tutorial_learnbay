## 1. Overview

Python comment is used to avoid deleting the complete line of codes which may be useful in later stages of programming.

 


## 2. Scope of This Tutorial 

This tutorial will cover


●      What is a python comment?


●      Different ways of creating a comment.

 

 


## 3. What is a Python Comment?

A Python comment is used for the following reasons:

 


●      Explaining or marking a python code is known as a comment.


●      ‘#’ is utilized at the beginning of the line stating the system to disregard the entire line.


●      Preventing the execution of code whenever it is tested.

 


## 4. Different ways of creating a comment

A python comment begins with '#,' where the program line is just ignored. '#' alternatively, it may be placed towards the end of the code, where python still does not consider those.

Example of Python comment:


```
# Print the statement
print("Hello, Good Morning!")
 
print("Hello, Good Morning!") #Print this statement
 
# print("Hello, Good Morning!")
print("Say, Hello!")
```


 

**Note**: Any line of code having '#' in front is considered a commented line

 


## 5. Python Comments in Multi-Line

To comment on a multi-line, just add '#' at the start of each line.

 

Example:

# Do not execute the first line

# Execute the second line

# print(“Hello, Good Morning!”)

print(“Say, Hello!”)


## 6. Python Multi Line comment using string

A multi-line string utilizing triple quotes in the code is also considered a comment as python will not consider string literals when it is not assigned to a variable.

 

“””

Do not execute the first line

Execute the second line

print(“Hello, Good Morning!”)

“””

print(“Say, Hello!”)

 


## 7. Why are python comments considered to be more important?


●      When a group is executing a project, the comments help in understanding the program better.


●      It helps in indicating why the particular line of code is important.

 


## 8. Summary

It is the best practice to use comment rather than deleting the code completely so that if in case you need to refer to the code, you can have a look at it. For single-line comments, use '#,' and for comments like a paragraph, use the string with triple quotes.
