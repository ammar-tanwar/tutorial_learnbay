**Chapter 2(a):**

**Python Syntax**

 


## 1. Overview

As we came across in the previous topic, Python is a natural readable language. Python syntax is used to write programs in a command line or terminal.


## 2. Scope of this tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn about



* Python Syntax
* Python Indentation


## 3. Python Syntax example


```
Older version of Python
>>>print "Python, World!"
 
Newer version of Python
>>> print("Python, World")
Python, World
```


 

Note: The only thing that separates the new version from the previous one is the parenthesis ‘()’.

 


## 4. Python programming has a set of rules.


●      Every line of the python program is suspended once it is moved to a new line.


●      A programming line contains only tabs, spaces, and a comment


●      It has a string of characters in it that are suspended by EOL(End Of Line).

 


## 5. Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the empty spaces that are seen at the start of a code line. The indentation in code for other programming languages is just for readability, but in Python, indentation plays an important role. A block of code(four spaces) is used for indentation.

 

For example,


```
if 2 < 6:
 	print("Two is lesser than six")
```


 

If the indentation is missed in front of "print" then Python will throw an error. The only advantage of Python is that it will display what type of error occurred.

 


## 6. Python Variables

Any value assigned to a python program is known as a variable.

 

Example

x = 20

y = “Hi, how are you?”

 

Let’s see variables in detail in the variables chapter.

 


## 7. Let us summarise


●      In simple words, a group of codes that are used in the command line or terminal is known as python syntax.


●      Indentation These empty spaces are found at the beginning of code lines.


●      Variables are any value that is assigned to a Python program.
