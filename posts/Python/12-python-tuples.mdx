## 1. Overview

One of the common data types in Python is the tuple. Python tuples is a sequence that cannot be changed as it is immutable. Inserting one or many objects, not all of the same type, and separating them with a comma generates a tuple object.



## 2. Scope of this tutorial

This will cover


●      Definition of tuples in Python


●      Uses of Python tuples in basic operations


●      Basic operations while running a code in the Python tuples

 


## 3. What do you mean by tuples in Python?

It is a list of several elements that may be accessed by unpacking or indexing.

A tuple is a group of items enclosed in round brackets in Python and separated by commas. However, a tuple cannot be changed(immutable).

Example

 


```
#Creating a tuple with no values
emty_tup = ()
print(emty_tup)

Output
()

# non-empty tuple

#one approach of creating
tup = ('Python', 'Course')
print(tup)

Output
('Python', 'Course')

#another way of creating
tup1 = 'Python', 'World'
print(tup1)

Output
('Python', 'World')
Create a tuple that is immutable
An illustration of how the item assignment cannot be done is shown below.

#testing the immutability of tuples

tup_5 = (6, 8, 13, 72)
tup_5[0] = 'Numbers'
print(tup_5)

Output
TypeError				Traceback(most recent call last)
Input In [10], in <cell line: 4>()
	1 # testing the immutability of tuples
	3 tup_5 = (6, 8, 13, 72)
--- >4 tup_5[0] = 'Numbers'
	5 print(tup_5)

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```



## 4. How can Python tuples be used for basic operations?

There are multiple ways to perform the fundamental operations on a tuple. Let's explore each one in sequence, with examples.

 


### 
**1.**	**Tuple Concatenation**

You cannot modify any value in a tuple element since the tuple is immutable. A process known as tuple concatenation allows you to merge two tuples into a single tuple.

Example


```
#generating two tuple

tup1 = 2, 4, 6, 8
tup2 = ('data', 'HELLO', 'Good', 'Colour')

#concatenation of  tuple

print(tup1 + tup2)
Output
(2, 4, 6, 8, 'data', 'HELLO', 'Good', 'Colour')
```




1. **Repeating Tuple**

Any value inside a tuple that has to be repeated simply needs to be multiplied by several times.


```
# Creating tuple with repetition

tup_repeat = ('Python is a data science course at learnbay! ')*5
print(tup_repeat)

Output
```
Python is a data science course at learnbay! Python is a data science course at learnbay! Python is a data science course at learnbay! Python is a data science course at learnbay! Python is a data science course at learnbay!





2. **Slicing Tuples in Python**

Slicing is extracting a specific part for use in an operation while leaving the initial data unchanged. Python's slicing operation takes three parameters into account, of which two depend on the operational requirement.

Example


```
# Slicing of tuple

tup3 = (10, 34, 76, 87, 63, 22,65)
print(tup3[1 : ])
print(tup3[: : -1])
print(tup3[2:5])

Output
(76, 87, 63, 22, 65)
(65, 63, 76, 10)
(87, 63)
```




3. **Finding the Tuple's length**

Using the 'len' option, you can calculate the length of each value available within a tuple.

Example


```
# Finding the length of a tuple

tup_len = (5, 56, 69, 72, 86, 99, 'data', 'science',  'python', 'class')
print(len(tup_len))

Output
10
```




4. **Sorting of a tuple**

Python tuples can be sorted using the sort() method. When sorting using this technique, the tuple's actual contents are modified, and the in-place sort is carried out.

Example


```
#Using sort() to arrange a list of tuples according to the second item

#List-sorting functionality based on the second element of the tuple


def Sort_Tuple(tup_1):

#reverse = None (ascending order of sorting)
#key is set for sorting using the second element of
#sublist lambda is used
    tup_1.sort(key = lambda a: a[1])
    return tup_1

# a drive code
tup_1 = [('Guru', 10), ('Jason', 5), ('Ankil', 20), ('Sundar', 15)]

#print the sorted list of tuples
print(Sort_Tuple(tup_1))

Output
[('Jason', 5), ('Guru', 10), ('Sundar', 15), ('Ankil', 20)]
```




5. **Nesting of a tuple in Python**

When we have to concatenate tuples into nested tuples, we employ the "+" operator. Any attempt to access the index items and make modifications will result in an error. For nesting and concatenating operations, we utilize the symbol "+."

Example


```
tup_1 = (95, 55, 33, 27, 14, 85),
tup_2 = (52, 83, 45, 47, 70, 54),

print("The initial tuple includes: ")
print(tup_1)
print("The second tuple includes: ")
print(tup_2)

joint_result = tup_1 + tup_2

print("The tuple after concatenating: ")
print(joint_result)

Output
The initial tuple includes: 
((95, 55, 33, 27, 14, 85),)
The second tuple includes: 
((52, 83, 45, 47, 70, 54),)
The tuple after concatenating: 
((95, 55, 33, 27, 14, 85), (52, 83, 45, 47, 70, 54))
```



## 5. Basic operations to perform while running a code in the tuple



* len() – Calculating the length within a tuple
* min() – Listing the min value within a tuple
* max() – Listing the max value within a tuple
* count() – Listing the number of occurrences within a tuple
* index() – Listing the index value within a tuple

**_Note: Count and index are not functions, they are the methods_**

Example


```
#Finding the length, minimum, maximum, count, and index of a tuple
tuple = (10, 25, 38, 52, 87, 63, 10, 87)
print('The tuple's length: ', len(tuple))
print('Min value of the tuple: ', min(tuple))
print('Max value of the tuple: ', max(tuple))
print('Count of 87: ', tuple.count(87))
index = tuple.index(63)
print('Index of 63:  ', index)

Output
The tuple's length:  8
Min value of the tuple:  10
Max value of the tuple:  87
Count of 87:  2
Index of 63:   5
```



## 6. Summary

A tuple is a set in which modifications cannot be made. It is immutable, in other words. You would have a better knowledge and easier working with python tuples after going through the following explanations and examples.
