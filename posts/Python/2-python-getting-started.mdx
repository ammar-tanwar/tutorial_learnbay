# Python Getting Started


## 1. Overview

In this, you will learn how to install python and the different ways to check if python is already installed or not in the system.


## 2. Scopes of this tutorial

This tutorial will cover



* How to install Python?
* Different scenarios if python is already installed and not installed.


## 3. How to install Python?

There will be many of you using various operating systems.

Let us now see two different scenarios:


1. What if a system has Python already installed?


2. What if the system does not have Python installed?

 

To see if Python is already installed on Windows PC


a.	Type python in the search bar


b.	In the command prompt, run the below command

 

C:\Users\Your Name>Python - - version

To see if Python is already installed on Linux or Mac PC, then in Linux, check on the command line, and on Mac, use the Terminal and type:
 

Python - - version


If you notice that Python is not installed in the system, then you need to download it for free from the below website:

[https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

Once the installation is complete, you can do the above steps.

 


## 4. Now let's start using Python.

As Python is an interpreted language so a developer can write a program on a text editor and then use a python interpreter to execute the program.

 

Example

To run a python program on a command line:

 

C:\Users\Your Name>python welcomepython.py

 

In this example, "welcomepython.py" is the name of the python file.

“.py” is the python extension.

 

Are you excited about writing the first program in Python? Let us use welcomepython.py and start a simple python program which is possible in any of the text editors.

 

welcomepython.py

print(“Hello, Good Morning”)


<img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/python/Picture3.png"></img>


Once the program is completed, save the file.

Using the command prompt, locate the file where welcomepython.py is saved and run:

 

C:\Users\Your Name>python welcomepython.py

 

The output should be displayed as:

 

Hello, Good Morning

 

That is really awesome, you have made it right, and the python program is executed successfully.

 


## 5. Let us summarise

We have seen the different ways to check if Python is installed in various operating systems and execute the first python program.
