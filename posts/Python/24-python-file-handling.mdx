# **Chapter 10**


# **Python File Handling**


<img src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main/tutorial/python/Python+File+Handling.jpg"></img>



## 1. Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn about the various access methods for Python's modes in this tutorial. The ability to read data from a file and write data into a file is a crucial feature. Because the values are saved at the time of execution and erased after the program execution is over, the values stored in some variables are not stable. You analyze a lot of data while working on a larger program, and this data cannot be saved in variables since variables are volatile. We utilize files because they are non-volatile for addressing such a situation. The information is permanently kept on a backup device, such as a hard drive or pen drive.


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial covers



* Defining a file
* Different ways of accessing files in python


## 3. What is a file?



* It's a container where we save our data.
* It's a disk space where we store specific data.
* Any data that we want to reuse then we can keep in a file.


### **What are the different types of files?**

Object file, source file, audio file, video file, image file (JPEG, PNG...), text file, binary file.

In Python, we have two types of files



* Text files (text file, pdf file, .py file….)
* Binary files (Binary files are any files other than text files.)

Text files

Operations that can be executed using a text file

A file may be treated as CRUD operations.



* C- Create
* R- Read
* U- Update
* D- Delete

How to use a file?

Opening a file (Create/Open a file)

Reading a file

Writing a file

Closing a file

Things to consider when dealing with Python files



* A file should be opened first to be read or written
* A file should always be closed after the operations have been performed otherwise the changes will not be visible.


## 4. How to open a file in python?


```
file_object=open('file_name.extension','mode')
file_object is also known as a handle
```


Example


```
e=open('test.txt','w') # e- file_object/handle
```



## 5. How to close a file in python?


```
file_object.close()
```



## 6. Methods used on a text file in python

The handle is used to access each of the functions below.

**read()**- You can read files with it. It begins reading where the cursor is and continues until the finish of the data.

**write()**- It is used to write into a file

**tell()**- It tells the position of the cursor

**seek()**- It shifts the cursor to the indexes further as specified


## 7. Different modes of accessing the files in python


## read mode - ‘r’



* When a file is already present it opens the file in read mode.
* It provides a file not found error if the file doesn't exist.
* Only reading the information from the file is possible but we cannot write to the file.
* The default mode is read mode 'r'

ls - It returns the list of all the files in the current directory

1. When the file does not exist-

    ```
e=open('test.txt', 'r')

Output
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FileNotFoundError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-a6c25506173e> in <module>
      1 #  1- When file does not exist
      2 
----> 3 e=open('test.txt','r')

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test.txt'
```



    ```
e=open('test.txt')

e=open('test.txt','r')
print(e.read())
# e.write("One more line added")
e.close()

Output
Hello world
This is a text file.
We have created it in Python.

seek(), tell()
e=open('test.txt','r')
print(e.tell())
e.seek(11)
print(e.read())
print(e.tell())
print(e.read())
e.seek(0)
print(e.read())

Output
0

This is a text file.
We have created it in Python.
61

Hello world
This is a text file.
We have created it in Python.
```




## Write mode- ‘w’



* If the file is not available, it is generated with the specified filename and extension.
* If the already exists then it opens the file and deletes the contents of the file.
* We are allowed to write into the file but we can not read from the file.

    ```
Example
e=open('learnbay.txt','w')
e.write("This file has been created using 'w' mode.")
# e.read()
e.close()

e=open('learnbay.txt','r')
print(e.read())
e.close()

Output
This file has been created using 'w' mode.
```



**Create a .py file that takes two numbers as input from the users and returns the addition**


```
e=open('add.py')
print(e.read())
e.close()
a=10
b=20
c=a+b
print(c)

e=open('add.py','w')
e.write("a=int(input('Enter a number-''))\n")
e.write("b=int(input('Enter the second number- '))\n")
e.write("c=a+b\n")
e.write("print(c)")
e.close()

e=open('add.py')
print(e.read())
e.close()

a=int(input('Enter a number-''))
b=int(input('Enter the second number- '))
c=a+b
print(c)

Enter a number-50
Enter the second number- 500
550
```



## Append mode ‘a’



* The cursor is placed at the end of the file and the file is opened in write mode.
* If the file is not available in the location then it creates a new file with the provided filename and extension.
* We are permitted to write to the file, but reading from the file is not permitted.
* seek() is not used with append mode.

    ```
e=open('test.txt','a')
e.seek(11)
e.write("This line is added using append mode.")
e.close()
e=open('test.txt','r')
print(e.read())

Hello world
This is a text file.
```



We have created it in Python. This line is added using append mode.

If it does not exist


```
e=open('test_append.txt','a')
e.write("This is a new file.\n")
e.write("This file has been created using append mode")
e.close()

e=open('test_append.txt','r')
print(e.read())

Output
This is a new file.
This file has been created using append mode
```



## Read and write mode 'r+'



* If the file exists then it opens the file in the read mode and places the cursor at the beginning.
* A file not found error message will be displayed if the file is unavailable.
* We are allowed to read the data from the file and we are also allowed to write the data into the file.

    ```
e=open('test.txt')
print(e.read())
e.close()
This is Python class

e=open('test.txt','w')
e.write('We are from Learnbay')
e.close()

'We are from Learnbay'
'Hello from Learnbay

e=open('test.txt','r+')
e.write("Hello")
e.seek(0)
print(e.read())

Hello from Learnbay

e=open('test.txt','w')
e.write('We are from Learnbay')
e.close()

e=open('test.txt','r+')
print(e.read()) 
# The position of the cursor is the end of the file after read()
print(e.tell())
e.write('We are learning Python')
e.seek(0)
print(e.read())
e.close()

We are from LearnbayWe are learning PythonWe are learning PythonWe are learning PythonWe are learning PythonWe are learning PythonWe are learning PythonWe are learning Python
174

e=open('test.txt','r')
print(e.tell())
e.close()

0
```




## append and read mode 'a+'



* If the file is available, the application opens it in read mode and positions the cursor at the finish.
* It will generate a fresh file with the specified filename and extension if the specified file does not previously exist.
* We are permitted to read from the file as well as write into it.
* Whatever we write that is appended at the end of the file so seek() is not applicable

    ```
e=open('test_append.txt','a+')
e.write("New line")
e.seek(0)
print(e.read())
e.close()

This is a new file.
This file has been created using append modeNew line

e=open('test_append.txt','r')
print(e.read())

e=open('test_append.txt','a+')
e.seek(10)
e.write("New line")
e.close()

e=open('test_append.txt','r')
print(e.read())
e.close()

This is a new file.
This file has been created using append modeNew lineNew line
```




## 8. Summary

In this tutorial, the fundamental operations of managing files in Python have been covered, including reading, writing, appending, etc. Then, we saw the function, which has a variety of modes for working with files, including reading "r," writing "w," appending "a," etc. There are also a variety of functions, including read(), write(), close(), and others.
