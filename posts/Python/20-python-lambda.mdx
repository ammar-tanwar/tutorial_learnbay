## 1. Overview

Anonymous functions known as lambda functions can only have one expression in them. Python lambda functions are an advanced or intermediate feature, yet you will learn how to use them in your code instantly.


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial covers



* Definition of the Python lambda function
* Utilization of the Python lambda function


## 3. What do you mean by lambda function in Python?

A function without a name is referred to as an anonymous function. The lambda keyword in Python is used in order to provide an anonymous function. Multiple arguments may be sent to a lambda function with just one expression.


## 4. How are Python lambda functions utilized?

The following is the syntax for a lambda function in Python.

Syntax - (arguments: expression, condition)



* Anywhere the function objects are required, lambda functions could be utilized.
* It's essential to understand that the lambda function is syntactically restricted to a unique expression.
* It serves a range of functions, as well as different sorts of expressions within functions, in multiple programming disciplines.

Example


```
x=(lambda a,b:a+b)
x(10,20)

Output
30
```


Example2


```
# Create a program that takes any number and displays if it is even or odd using the lambda function

(lambda x:'even' if x%2==0 else 'odd')(int(input("Enter a number ")))

Output
Enter a number 23
'odd'
```



## 5. Why Are Lambda Functions Useful?

When the Python lambda function is utilized as an anonymous function within another function, its power is better demonstrated. Usually, Python uses it as an argument for a higher-order function (a function that takes input from other functions). In addition to using built-in methods like filter() and map(), lambda functions are also utilized.


### **filter() utilizing Lambda function**

In Python, the filter() method takes two arguments: a function and an iterable, like a list. Every item in the list is passed to the function, which returns a new iterable or list containing just the items that were provided with True when the function was called on it. It also returns a filter object.

Based on the reasoning supplied in the function, it returns a set of values from the iterable.

Example


```
lst=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Create a function that returns the even numbers from the above list

list(filter(lambda x:x%2==0,lst))

Output
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```


Example 2


```
# We can apply a loop on a filter object to get the values

flt=filter(lambda x:x%2==0,lst)
print(flt)

for i in flt:
    print(i)

Output
<filter object at 0x000001EC59B8AF70>
2
4
6
8
10
```


Example 3


```
#Take two lists
# lst1[1,10]
# lst2[100,110]
# Create a dictionary where
# keys = even numbers from lst1
# values= even numbers from lst2

lst1=[i for i in range(1,11)]
lst2=[i for i in range(101,111)]

flt1=filter(lambda x:x%2==0,lst1)
flt2=filter(lambda x:x%2==0,lst2)

dict(zip(flt1,flt2))

Output
{2: 102, 4: 104, 6: 106, 8: 108, 10: 110}
```



## 6. Advantages of Lambda function



* Perfect for clear and simple, straightforward logical procedures. This makes the code easier to read as well.
* Useful if you need a function that you will only use once.


## 7. Disadvantages of Lambda function



* They are restricted to one expression. Multiple independent operations cannot be included within a single lambda function.  
* Not favorable for tasks that would need more than one line in a standard def function (Nested conditional operations, for example). Utilize the named function in its place if you require a few minutes to understand the code.
* This is bad because, unlike in a typical def function, you cannot provide a doc-string to describe all the inputs, actions, and outputs. 


### **Using Multiple Statements with Lambda**

Lambda functions cannot contain more than one expression at a time, but we may create two or more functions and then call the second lambda expression like an argument to the first.

Example


```
my_List = [ [3, 5, 8, 6], [23, 54, 12, 87], [1, 2, 4, 12, 5] ]  
  
# sorting every sublist of the above list  
sort_List = lambda num : ( sorted(n) for n in num )  
  
# Getting the third largest number of the sublist  
third_Largest = lambda num, func : [ l[ len(l) - 2] for l in func(num)]

result = third_Largest( my_List, sort_List) 

print( result )

Output
[6, 54, 5]
```



## 8. Summary

If your function has just one brief expression, lambda functions are an efficient method to write them. Normally, they are not something that beginners utilize, but in this case, you have seen how simple it is to use them at any skill level.
