# Python Variables

## 1. Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn about python variables and how to use them in programming.

 


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

This tutorial will cover


●      Variables in python


●      Multi-object pointing to a single object

 


## 3. What are the variables in python?

A name that is assigned to a particular object is called a variable. You can create a variable by actually giving it a value before using it.

 

Example


```
x = 10
y = 'Hello'
```


 

Here x and y are the variables, and 10 and 'Hello' are the values.

 

Once the value is assigned to the variable, you can call the variable to execute the value.

 

Example


```
x = 10
y = 'Hello'
 
print(x)
print(y)
 
Output
10
'Hello'
```


 

**_Note_**: If you assign a new value to the variable, then at execution, the latest assigned value will be considered for the respective variable.

 

Python also has a special advantage. If you need the same values for more than one variable, it is possible to assign them all at once, and it will assign the same memory location/address for each of the variables.

 

Example


```
a = b = c = 500
print (a, b, c)
 
Output
500 500 500
```


 


```
a = b = c = 500
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(id(c))
 
Output
2832928830928
2832928830928
2832928830928
```



## 4. Multi reference pointing to a single object

If multiple variables are pointing to a single object, python just adds a new name or reference that will point to the same object.

 

Example


```
i = 433
j = i
 
i --> 433 ← j
```


 

Here both the variables will have the same output as 433.

 

A variable need not be a single alphabet; it could be of any length, which can consist of lowercase, uppercase letters (a-z, A-Z), the underscore (_), and numbers from (0-9).

 

Example


```
name = 'Python'
Location2 = 'India'
```


 

**_Note_**: A variable can contain a number, but the first character should always remain an alphabet.

 

Example


```
1222_Roll = 54
A syntax error: an invalid token will pop up.
```


 


## 5. Summary

A variable is nothing but actually giving it a value before using it. A variable can be expressed in any form of alphabets and numbers, but the only condition is that it should not have a number in the beginning.
