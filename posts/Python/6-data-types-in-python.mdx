# Data Types in Python

## 1. Overview

Any programming language you choose requires users to write the information/code in a number of ways. Therefore for a program to run, this is essential to have a good knowledge of data types & their respective operations. Data types, which include multiple data items like integers, float, complex, list, string, tuple, etc., are used in programming.

 


## 2. Scope of the article

This tutorial will cover


●      Data type in Python


●      Data type categorization

 


## 3. What do you mean by data type in Python?

Data types refer to the classification or categorization of data components. This can be simply defined as the value that indicates which operation should be performed on the provided set of data. As everything in Python programming is an object, data types constitute classes, and variables constitute instances (objects) of these classes.

 


## 4. Data types in Python are categorized into six types.

 


●      Numeric


●      String


●      List


●      Tuple


●      Set


●      Dictionary

 


### Numeric Data Types in Python

Numbers deployed as integers, floats, and complex numbers are used to represent numerical data types.

 

A numerical data type is further classified into three types


●      Integer


●      Float


●      Complex

 

**Integer** - Regardless of whether it is positive or negative, any number displayed as a whole number is known as an integer.

 

Example


```
x = 234
y = 3409
p = 1039
d = 25
```


 

**Float** - Any number displayed with a decimal point is called float.

 

Example

 


```
a= 34.54
b= 945.833
c= 25.00
```


 

**Complex** -  A combination of a real component and an imaginary part is used to represent the complex number. The letter "j" at the end of the integer indicates the imaginary portion.

 

Example


```
a+bj
7+4j
```


 


### **String data types in Python**

A string is a collection of Unicode elements. To access the values, characters must always be enclosed in single, double, or triple quote marks. Square brackets and indexes are required in order to extract the value from the string. In Python, it is denoted by the word "str."

 

Example


```
f = 'Hello Guys'
g = "hello guys"
k = '''HELLO GUYS'''
```


 


### **List data types in Python**

All the components of a list are enclosed in square brackets '[ ]' and separated by commas (,). Any data type, including int, float, etc..… can be stored in the list as items. Because the list is mutable, its elements can be modified.

 

Example


```
lst = [2, 42, 5.982, 'Python']
print (lst)
 
Output
[2, 42, 5.982, 'Python']
```


 


### **Tuple data types in Python**

In Python, a tuple is expressed by enclosing each element in a round bracket () and separating them with a comma (,). Any type of data can be kept in a tuple as components such (int, float, etc.). The fact that its elements cannot be modified since they are immutable is the only drawback.

 

Example


```
tpl = (23, 54, 12.545, 'Python')
print(tpl)
 
Output
(23, 54, 12.545, 'Python')
```


 


### **Set data types in Python**

A set does not have a specified order; it is Iterable and changeable. It has no indexes in it. It is shown by enclosing it in curly brackets and separating it with a comma. Since a set excludes duplicate entries, the result will only include unique values.

 

Example


```
set = {1, 45, 34.342, 'Python'}
print(set)
 
Output
{'Python', 1, 34.342, 45}
```


 


### **Dictionary data types in Python**

A dictionary is a set of values containing unordered data. Instead of a single value element, it stores a key-value pair. Use the key name, which is the key enclosed in square brackets, to access an item from a dictionary. A dictionary data type would be the most beneficial if you had to handle a large amount of data. Its purpose is to return to the state in which it is optimum. When specifying this data type, we utilize curly brackets ‘{ }’.

 

Example


```
dictionary = {'P' : 'Python', 'H' : 'Hello'}
dictionary['H']
dictionary.get('P')
```


 


```
Output
'Hello'
'Python'
```



## 5. Summary

 

Finally, what we can say is that data types in Python refer to the classification or categorization of data components. It is divided into six categories, each of which has unique attributes and features.
