## 1. Overview

Boolean is the representation of the truth value, which consists of only two expression values, either 'True' or 'False.'


## 2. Scopes of this tutorial

This tutorial will cover


●      Boolean data types in Python?


●      Boolean methods


●      Boolean operators

 


## 3. What is a boolean in Python?

The boolean data type is one of Python's built-in data types. It provides a representation of an expression's truth value. At the same time, evaluating boolean consists of only two expression values, either true or false. Comparison of values will also return boolean values.

 

Example


```
g = 10
h = 5
 
print(g>h)
print(g==h)
 
Output
True
False
```


 

The type bool won't be used for any other value. The built-in type() allows you to check the True and False types.

 

Example


```
type(False)
type(True)
 
Output
<class 'bool'>
<class 'bool'>
```


 

The keywords aren't built-in names. Variables can have a Boolean value assigned to them, but the boolean values (True, False) cannot have a value assigned to them. Because True is 1 and False is 0 in Python.

Example

 


```
d_true = True
print(d_true)
 
Output
True
 
True = 34
print(True)
 
Output
Input In [3]
True = 34
^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to True
 
False = 870
print(False)
 
Output
Input In [4]
False = 870
^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to False
```


 


## 4. Python bool() method

A set of examples would make more sense than an explanation.

**_ _**

**_Note_**: An empty set, empty mapping, and 'None' will result in as False

 


```
#a returns False as a is None
a = None
print(bool(a))
 
Output
False
 
#Returns false as r is not equal to y
r = 5
y = 10
print(bool(r==y))
Output
False
 
#Returns false as r sequence is empty
r = ()
print(bool(r))
 
Output
False
 
#Returns false as r mapping is empty
r = {}
print(bool(r))
 
Output
False
 
#Returns True as r is not an empty string
r = 'Hello'
print(bool(r))
 
Output
True
```


 

Without utilizing the bool() function, expressions can also be evaluated. A comparison of some kind will result in the Boolean values being returned.

 


```
Example
x=10
y=20
 
print(x==y)
Output: False
```


 


## 5. Boolean Operators

Boolean operations are comparison operations between two different values, and after comparison, the output from the boolean operator will be either True or False. Boolean operators that are most frequently used are


●      OR


●      AND


●      NOT


●      == (equal to)


●      !=(not equal to)

 

Example


```
d = 2
e = 5
f = 2
                        	
if d>e or d==f:
 	print(True)
else:
 	print(False)
 
if d or e or f:
 	print("Value contains the boolean element")
 
Output
True
Value contains the boolean element.
```


 

A boolean value has only two expressions, either True or False. Boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT, ==, and != are commonly used as boolean operators.
