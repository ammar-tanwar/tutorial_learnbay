# **The Basics of The Normal Distribution**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The most common description of distribution utilized in technical market research and other statistical evaluations is the normal distribution. The two variables are the mean and the standard deviation which comprises the standard normal distribution.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is the normal distribution?
* What is the empirical rule?
* The formula of normal distribution.
* Example of a Normal Distribution.


## 3. What is the normal distribution?

A likelihood distribution that is accurate regarding the mean is considered the normal distribution and is also sometimes attributed to the Gaussian distribution. It indicates that data that are close to the mean occur quite often rather than data that are distant from the mean.

The appearance of the normal distribution is as a "bell curve" on a diagram.

Figure 1: Bell Curve Image

The normal distribution is characterized by a set of significant characteristics and attributes.

The first observation to make is the fact that the data's mean, median, and mode are the most common observations Moreover, all of these values display the distribution's height or highest point. The distribution then differs significantly uniformly from the mean, through the standard deviation functioning as a measure of its width.


**Note:**

The only two variables are the mean and standard deviation which can be applied to summarize any normal distribution.


## 4. What is the empirical rule?

68.2% of observed data will come between +/- 1σ of the mean including all normal distributions, 95.4% would come between +/- 2σ, whereas 99.7% should lie inside +/- 3σ. The above fact, often considered the "empirical rule," is a criterion that suggests where the majority of the observations in a normal distribution could be distributed.


## 5. The formula of normal distribution.


x is the variable's or data's value which is analyzed, and f(x) is the probability function.

The mean is 
.

The standard deviation is equal to 


## 6. The example of a Normal Distribution

Several naturally occurring incidences seem to be normally distributed. Let us consider the distribution of students' heights from a school as an example. Including both males and girls, the appropriate measure is determined to be between 175 cm (5' 9").

The figure below indicates that most students fit into a certain average. Similarly, even though they are less widespread in the population, taller and shorter individuals definitely appear. The empirical rules specify approximately 99.7% of all student’s heights would range around 154 cm (5' 0") and 196 cm (6' 5"), or +/- three standard deviations from the mean.  A very small portion of people (only 0.15% of the population each) would be taller and shorter than this.

## 7. Conclusion

The bell curve usually signifies a normal distribution of data Therefore some data might well show two humps or a sequence of hills.

This is all about normal distribution. Our following topic is the empirical rule of normal distribution.
