# **The Basics of The Index in Statistics**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

Index numbers contribute significantly due to their being helpful in understanding how considerably the industry has recovered over a given period of time. The impacts of such modifications to variables that cannot be observed directly are examined by index numbers.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What are index numbers?
* What are the features of index numbers?
* Application of Index.
* What are the types of indexes?
* Example of Index.


## 3. What are index numbers?

Index numbers serve as the most significant element in the study of statistics. If you were to change the variable in the estimation of any particular statistics, just imagine how it would be without these data! The procedure will be wholly ineffectual in and of itself. The statistic of any modification in a unit variable or variables over a specified time is hence conducted through index numbers. Such figures represent a broad relative change instead of a specific quantifiable value. A percentage is applied to denote an index number.


## 4. What are the features of index numbers?



* Where accurate analysis cannot be conducted, this specific estimate category serves to detect relative changes.
* The index number testing method ranges from one associated variable to the next.
* It enables measuring the levels of a happening on a specified day to those recorded on earlier dates.
* It shows evidence of an unusual average, especially true for a composite index.


## 5. Application of Index

In statistics, index numbers are often applied to facilitate the development of successful strategies. These findings also assist in the advancement of research.

It generates capital modifications to primary data, which is essential for the economic slowdown. It promotes the conversion from nominal wages to real wages faster and easier.

## 6. What are the types of indexes?

Specific kinds of index numbers are implemented in unique situations.  Letâ€™s recognize the contribution of each type in the context of the work that is being practiced:


### **Value Index:**

The percentage of the average value of the target period to the total value determined in the estimation period generates a value index number. The value index is often used, besides these aspects, for supplies, marketing, world commerce, etc.


### **Quantity Index:**

When measuring changes in the composition or quantity of the products that are manufactured, utilized, and purchased within a particular time frame, a quantity index number is performed. It represents the relative change during a time period for unique product quantities. An indication of the need for a quantity index would be the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).


### **Price Index:**

In the estimation of the way the prices change over time, a price index number is performed. Instead of showing an absolute number, this would show the relative number. Prominent features of pricing indexes would include Consumer Price Index or CPI and Wholesale Price Index WPI.


### **Note:**

Index numbers are therefore established by applying a variety of approaches. Such uniqueness of methodologies might produce a distinct set of values that will be reported, which could further present a challenge.


## 7. Example of Index

For instance, the "market bag" for a predefined year is provided an index value of 100 in the Index of Consumer Prices. When the price of a market bag is 55 in 2019 and significantly increases in the upcoming year, in 2020, the index would expand to 200. To calculate this, just divide the cost of the brand-new year's market bag by the cost of the previous year which is also known as the base year, and after that multiply the quotient by 100.


## 8. Conclusion

The index numbers, therefore, provide us with a rough estimation of the performance compared to changes that are occurring.

This is all about the indexes. Our following topic will be a square matrix.
