# **The Basics of the Statistical Significance**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

In real life, the p-value should be very low for rejecting the null hypothesis, thus the significance level is usually mentioned before. A researcher may possibly be unable to compare the outcomes of two distinct tests because different researchers apply different levels of significance when analyzing a question. This issue can be resolved with P-values.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is statistical significance?
* Understanding statistical significance with the use of P-values. 
* Example of the statistical significance.
* Disadvantages of relying entirely on statistical significance.


## 3. What is statistical significance?

A conclusion of the null hypothesis, which suggests that the outcomes are exclusively the result of chance, is commonly known as statistical significance. When a data set's p-value is low enough, statistical significance is displayed.

Whenever the p-value is high, the outcomes in the data are appropriate for the null hypothesis because they can be understood by chance alone.


## 4. Understanding statistical significance with the use of P-values 

P-values often are usually applied by researchers to identify the statistical significance of a specific trend we have observed.

A statistical test's p-value should be modest enough to reject the null hypothesis for the test to be considered significant statistically.

How small is too small? A most frequent cutoff is p 0.05, which means that we must only assume getting a test statistic as extreme as the one obtained by our test 5% of said time. Although the cutoff completely depends on our field of research; several fields support cutoffs of 0.01, and even 0.001.

The alpha value (a) is another name for the defined threshold that is used to assess statistical significance.

**Note:**

Determining a significance level prior to actually conducting our investigation is best practice. Otherwise, we can also find it simple to manipulate the data to abide by our study predictions.


## 5. Example of the statistical significance


**Note:**

We need to consider significant descriptive statistics about our data, like means or standard deviations, in addition to the test statistic and p-value at the time of reporting statistical significance.

 We noticed that our hypothesis test consists of a p-value of 0.0029. We consider our data statistically significant and reject the null hypothesis as this p-value is lesser than our significance level of 0.05.

Accordingly, the research manipulation could be made accountable for the change in happiness scores amongst the various groups.

The test group (M = 4.67, SD = 2.14) observed statistically more happiness compared to the control group (M = 3.81, SD = 1.92); this corresponds to consistent well with alternative hypothesis; t(108) = 2.22, p =.0029.


## 6. Disadvantages of relying entirely on statistical significance

When sample size can have an influence on statistical significance, statistical significance in itself might be confusing. Regardless of whether the effects are small or insignificant in the real world, we are still more likely to get statistically significant results using extraordinarily large samples. This suggests that relevant studies are neglected whenever they fail to meet the significance threshold, however, smaller impacts are commonly overestimated when they meet the threshold.


## 7. Conclusion

Consequently, high-quality replication studies usually fail to generate accurate results with statistical significance. This is the reason that many researchers are rejecting statistical significance as a method of making decisions in favor of more complex methods of achieving their goals.

This is all about the statistical significance. Our following topic will be null and alternative hypotheses.
