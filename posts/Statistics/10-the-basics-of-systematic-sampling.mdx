## 1. Overview of the Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn how systematic sampling is the best approach for surveys when there is little probability of data manipulation. If your population is structured repetitively or irregularly, you shouldn't conduct systematic sampling because the appropriateness of the sample you get cannot be confirmed.

## 2. Scope of The Tutorial

● Definition of Systematic Sampling.

● When is Systematic Sampling to be used?

● Selection of population.

● Systematic sampling without population.

● Example of systematic sampling.

## 3. What is Systematic Sampling?

Systematic sampling is a probabilistic technique in which analysts pick participants at fixed times (or k).

This method will allow you to obtain a representative sample that can be used to make assumptions about the population when any order of the population is random or random-appearing (for example, alphabetical).

## 4. When is Systematic Sampling Used?

Simple random sampling has significant advantages over systematic sampling regarding randomization, but systematic sampling is somewhat simpler to perform.

Comparable to essential random sampling, systematic sampling can be performed using a list of the total population. Compared to a simple random sample, you can still utilize this technique if you haven't had access to a list of your population beforehand.

## 5. Classification of The Population

To confirm that your sample is accurate when performing systematic sampling with a population list, we need to remember the order in which our population is listed.

Systematic sampling also should enable you to obtain a suitably representative sample regardless of our population arranged in ascending or descending order.

## 6. Systematic sampling without a population list

If we don't have access to an entire list of the population beforehand, systematic sampling can be applied to depict the randomization of a simple random sample.

### 1. Defining The Population:

When collecting data in systematic sampling, we get 2 choices:

● We select our sample from a list in advance and then approach the chosen participants to gather data, or

● We can ask every k<sup>th</sup> person in our population of interest to volunteer in our study by asking them.

### **2. Determining the sample size and sampling interval selections:**

We should first determine our sample size before deciding our interval. There are many ways to pick a sample size, whereas using a sample size calculator is probably the most effective.

The above calculator will give us the sample size we should target after selecting the desired margin of error and confidence level, estimated population size, and standard deviation of the variables we are attempting to measure.

Once we are informed of our desired sample size, we can calculate our interval, k, by dividing our sample size by the total predicted size of the population. Rather than an accurate calculation, this could be a rough estimation.

### **3. Selecting the sample and collecting data:**

When we possess a list of our population, select a random position on the list as a sample's initial point, then select any following member at random.

When we don't have a list, we have to select each of the population's k<sup>th</sup> members for our sample while we gather the data for our study.

## 7. Example for Systematic Sampling

Any 20<sup>th</sup> customer that exits the shop is surveyed by a determined employee who remains by the door. It is essential that as many of the participants picked for the sample choose to participate; otherwise, our results may not accurately reflect the opinions of the wider population.

Participants that have very positive or negative opinions about the store could be more eager to take part than the entire customers, which could skew the experiment's results.

## 8. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how systematic sampling is the best approach for surveys when there is little probability of data handling. Our next topic will be cluster sampling.
