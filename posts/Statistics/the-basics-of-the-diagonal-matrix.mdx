# **The Basics of The Diagonal Matrix**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

Among the most extensively utilized concepts in linear algebra is the matrix. The mathematical explanation of a diagonal matrix, its effects, and its instances are all discussed in detail in this tutorial.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is the diagonal matrix?
* Form of Diagonal Matrices.


## 3. What is the diagonal matrix?

A diagonal matrix throughout linear algebra is a matrix including all zero variables that lie outside the principal diagonal; the name applies especially to square matrices. The principal diagonal's elements may consist of zero or non-zero components. 

A 2 x 2 diagonal matrix diagram is

However, the 3 x 3 diagonal matrix instance is

A diagonal matrix will be any identity matrix of any measurement or another multiple of it is a scalar matrix. Because it is the fact that scaling happens whenever the diagonal matrix is multiplied by another matrix, it is commonly referred to as a scaling matrix (size). The conjunction from its diagonal elements generates its determinant.


## 4. Form of Diagonal Matrices



1. **Rectangular Diagonal Matrix**

Frequently when the expression "diagonal matrix" is utilized, it corresponds to the rectangular diagonal matrix, which consists of an m-by-n matrix containing zeros for every entry that is not of the type


For instance:

2. **Square Diagonal Matrices**

The name "diagonal matrix" has been more frequently applied to square matrices, which could be explicitly mentioned as a square diagonal matrix_._

This is additionally described as a symmetric diagonal matrix even though a square diagonal matrix is a symmetric matrix.

The square diagonal matrix depicted here is

**Note:**

It also functions as a normal matrix when the variables are real or complex integers.


## 5. How to Find the Diagonal of a Square Matrix? 

We should first consider the initial component in the first row and the end component in the last row in accordance with the determination of the diagonal that has a square matrix. Additionally, understand that all matrix elements are horizontal lines along with diagonal straight lines parallel.

In the above image, a horizontal line can be applied to connect the elements 9, 11, 4, & 10 diagonally. Consequently,  these elements are referred to as the square matrix's diagonal.


## 6. Effects of the Diagonal Matrices

According to its definition, a diagonal matrix will have the following elements.



* A square matrix appears throughout each diagonal matrix.
* The non-principal diagonal elements of the identity matrix, null matrix, and scalar matrix have all been instances of diagonal matrices.
* A diagonal matrix is constructed by adding two diagonal matrices.


## 7. Conclusion

Throughout linear algebra and also the theory of linear systems, diagonal matrices commonly occur. Accordingly, it is required to thoroughly understand the diagonal matrices that we have presented in this tutorial.

This is all about the diagonal matrix. Our following topic will be the identity matrix.
