## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial


The lesson for today emphasizes conditional probability. The conditional probability has the following precise definition:

 "For every conditional probability, there is a positive possibility as well as the negative possibility."

 


## 2. Scope of the Article



●  	In this article, we will learn what Conditional probability is


●  	How is conditional probability performed?



## 3. How to understand conditional probability?


The  Estimated probability of A under constraint B is commonly described as P(A|B) or  if the such occasion of interest is A and the occurrence B is regarded to have resulted or is thought to have performed so (A). This might also be regarded as the percentage of probability B where A exceeds B: 


Example:

 

While we consider the joint probabilities in the initial two paragraphs, it suggests that bringing an umbrella if it is not raining (0.40) seems to be more possible compared to when it is (0.20). We'll bring it back since it seems odd at this point. We will now identify the conditional probability of receiving the appropriate response. More such data should be included in the conditional probability formula.


= 0.80


= 0.53

Readers can understand from the conditional probabilities that individuals are much more inclined to be carrying an umbrella during rain (0.80) than they would be without rain (0.53). That seems to be reasonable.

 

These probable combination outcomes were unreliable given it refused to consider the fact that days without rain are three times more likely compared to days with rain (0.75 vs. 0.25)!

In this analysis, there are significantly more days without rain. Thus you are more inclined to see individuals bringing umbrellas throughout those times. The conditional probability reflects the above in consideration.

 

This conditional probability demonstration involves dependent events. We could perhaps tell it's the case because changing the first event affects the possibility of the second event. As a result, the probability of the second occurrence is based on the preceding one.

 


## 4. The Concluding Paragraph


In this tutorial, we learned conditional probability, which represents the ratio of the probabilities of both outcomes occurring in proportion to the probability that the specified event happens. In our next chapter, I will be discussing Baye’s Theorem.
