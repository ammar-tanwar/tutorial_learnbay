# **The Basics of The Trace of The Matrix**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The basic principle of a matrix's trace, its properties, and its examples are all described in this tutorial.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is a trace of a Matrix?
* Example for the trace of a matrix.


## 3. What is a trace of a Matrix?

To have a knowledge of a matrix's trace. Let us initially learn what a matrix is, the explanation of a matrix, matrix features, and matrix forms. The trace of a matrix is one such feature.

A rectangular collection of numbers or other mathematical structures placed into rows and columns are referred to as a matrix.

There are multiple types of matrices, however, the following are the most common:



* A matrix is called a _row matrix_ when it consists of one row.
* A matrix is considered a _"column matrix" _since it just includes one column.
* A matrix is known for being _rectangular_ when any quantity of rows and columns is not equal.
* _Square Matrix:_ When a matrix's total number of rows and columns is one, it is known to be square.
* _Diagonal Matrix:_ When all of the elements of the main diagonal are zero and at minimum one is non-zero then the square matrix is described as diagonal.
* _Diagonal matrices_ are defined as scalar when each diagonal element are identical.
* A diagonal matrix is considered to as being an identity matrix when each diagonal element represents one.
* The matrix created by flipping A's rows into A's columns is referred to as A's _transpose_ when A is a defined matrix. It is depicted as 


The diagonal elements of the available square matrix get summed up to form the trace for a matrix. The dependency of a matrix trace exists on the matrix being square.

**Note:**

The sum of the diagonal components of any given square matrix A is matching to the sum total of the eigenvalues of A. The summation for the provided matrix's eigenvalues is then the trace of the same matrix.


## 4. Example for the trace of a matrix.

Only a square matrix is required to form a matrix's trace. The matrix's diagonal components, which go from the top left to the lower right, are summed up. A matrix's trace can be applied to explain concepts in linear algebra.

Example: When A is the given matrix,

Therefore, the trace is equivalent to the total of its complex eigenvalues which is a + e + i.


## 5. Conclusion

The trace is the same for the matching matrices. The output of the determinant is applied to the trace. This is all about the trace of the matrix. Our following topic will be the analysis of variance.
