# **The Basics of The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will understand how ANOVA (analysis of variance) works. In a real-life scenario, we use ANOVA for testing. For example, we use ANOVA in a survey or in an experiment to check whether the result for them is significant or not.

* Example for the analysis of variance.


## 3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) - What's that?

ANOVA is a tool that is used for analysis in statistics that splits the observed variability of a data set into two parts that are as follows;



1. Systematic factors  
2. Random factors   

Ronald Fisher made the invention of ANOVA which stands for analysis of variance. Analysis of variance tells us that in three or more independent groups whether there is a statistical variance of means. How the dependent variable is connected to the independent variable is told by ANOVA in the regression study.


## 4. What does the Analysis of variance acknowledge?

The initial analysis factors affecting a data set are tested by ANOVA. After this test is done the methodical factors are performed by analysts to measurably contribute to the inconsistency of the data set.

The F statistics that is also called the F ratio is the result that we get from the ANOVA formula. It allows us in determining the variability between and within the sample and when no difference is found between the tested groups then the ANOVA’s result is close to 1. 

ANOVA is useful for testing three or more variables and its results in fewer type errors being appropriate for a range of issues. 


**Note:**

ANOVA helps us analyze the deviation in the mean that we have between two independent variables. However, what difference each statistical group is having from the other is not told by ANOVA.  


## 5. ANOVA - Formula

The formula for ANOVA is F =  

In the formula;

F = coefficient for ANOVA 

MST = Mean squares of treatment

MSE = Mean squares of error

The mean of each group is compared by the differences that are grouped by ANOVA. It includes the spreading out of the variance into diverse sources. 


## 6. Steps to perform for calculating ANOVA.



1. We need to find out the mean for each group.
2. Now, we need to find the overall mean (the mean of all the groups). 
3. Next is to find all variations of each group which is to find the total deviation from the group mean.
4. At last, we need to find the variation between groups that is the difference from all the mean of the group to the overall mean (this is the finding of the F- ratio)

## 8. Conclusion

We have a multitude of options for statistical analysis for comparing two or more sets of data. One such way to find the inconsistency by testing is an analysis of variance. The benefit of ANOVA over other statistical analyses of variance is that it separates observed variance data into a small fraction to be used for additional tests.

This is all about the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Our following topic will be the analysis of covariance.
