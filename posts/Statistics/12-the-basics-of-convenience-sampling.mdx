## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial


The most common technique of non-probability sampling is convenience sampling. Being quick and inexpensive, helps us to perform our research fast and for minimal cost, which may make using the sampling approach  more beneficial than investing in extensive research studies.


## 2. Scope of The Study



* Convenience Sampling-Definition.
* When to use convenience sampling?
* How systematic sampling is performed with an example?


## 3. Defining Convenience Sampling

Rather than just selecting individuals at random based on a specific list of requirements, researchers are using this survey design to choose the persons at random who are interested in being interviewed and participating in the research.

This denotes that we can get in touch with our sample any time we want and from anywhere location, be it some individuals in a supermarket, a store, a company, or an online forum. All of these provide chances to do research. Because of this, this kind of sampling technique is also called grab sampling, opportunity sampling, availability sampling, and accidental sampling.

It works much better when utilized as a pilot study before conducting extensive research, as part of hypothesis-generating, or to evaluate public opinion.

## 4. Application of convenience sampling

Convenience sampling might be the preferred solution to help us get the results when our circumstances are as follows:



* When our budget is low for the research,
* When for a particular sample we don't have access to all of the population,
* When we need to act quickly according to our requirements to meet a deadline,
* When the opinions, habits, and values of the audience are needed by the managers before starting full-scale research, etc.


## 5. How to use convenience sampling?



* Determine the purpose of the research.
* Confirm the intended audience that will support your research.
* Decide the place to go to meet these people in a responsible way. 
* Create a survey with the research-related questions that need to be asked.
* Ask for participants to join in your convenience sample, and next present your survey to them.


## 6. The Convenience Sampling Examples

Example: 

Receiving the public's feedback on a brand event (e.g. the announcement of a new gaming product).

During the launch of their company's new game, a researcher would join an online gaming community or stand at the entrance of a gaming store. They could request forum individuals or customers that enter or exit the shop to participate in a survey and provide feedback on the game. Researchers may ask the participants in the survey if they purchased the game, whether they liked it or not, and also how they considered its different features (such as the graphics, theme, pace, etc.)


## 7. Conclusion

Provide multiple samples so that you can test the same questions on many groups of conveniently reachable and interested participants. This allows you to draw predictions relying on a comprehensive set of data and analyze results over time. Our next tutorial topic will be quota Sampling.
