## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial




The concept of "dispersion" derives from the fact that items within a set vary from one another in size and that there is a lack of regularity in their size.

The measures of dispersion-standard deviation are a very critical calculation in statistics.

## 2. Scope of The tutorial





● What does dispersion mean in statistics?


● What are the measures of dispersion, and how do we perform it?



## 3. What are dispersions?




A statistical technique called dispersion represents the spread of a series of mathematical data compared to its central tendency. The three principal dispersions are categorized as _range, variance, and standard deviation_.

A low dispersion value represents the significant consistency of the measurements. The data's perfect uniformity is indicated by the absence of dispersion. So, if all of the observations are the same, this result occurs.

  **Figure 1: Measures of dispersion**


**Note:**




● It indicates the accuracy of a central value measure.


● It provides the comparison of two data series in respect of their variability.


● Variability can be reduced on the basic principle of a dispersion measure.


● It offers a broad range of uses across almost all domains of statistics.



## 4. Different Dispersion Type





### **Range**



The difference between the higher and lower numbers in a set of numbers is called range.

**_Example:_**

1, 4,5, 6, 7

Range = 7 -1= 6




### **Variance**

Variance is the average differences among each data point as well as the dataset's overall mean. To measure variance:



Find the mean of the data and subtract the mean from all the numbers in the dataset; after that square the outcome so that it becomes positive, of these squared differences, find the mean.

**_ _**

**_Example:_**

46,69,32,60,52,41

Mean = (46+69+32+60+52+41)6 = 50

As we have our mean to be 50, we need to take out 50 from all of the scores.

46 – 50 = -4

69 – 50 = 19

32 – 50 = -18

60 – 50 = 10

52 – 50 = 2

41 – 50 = -9

Now, we must square each deviation from the mean to achieve the positive number. This can be obtained by multiplying each deviation by the mean by itself.

4 × 4 = 16

19 × 19 = 361

-18 × -18 = 324

10 × 10 = 100

2 × 2 = 4

-9 × -9 = 81

Now all the squared deviation needs to be summed up.

16 + 361 + 324 + 100 + 4 + 81 = 886

Now we need to divide the sum that we received from the squares.

We need to divide it by n – 1 (this is applicable for a sample) or N (this is applicable for a population).



As here in this example, we're working with a sample, so n – 1 will be used where n = 6.

886/(6 – 1) equals 886 5 equals 177.2

The variance received is 177.2




### **Standard Deviation-Explanation**



The square that we obtain from the variance is called the standard deviation. When the standard deviation is significantly low, then the data really tends to be close to the mean. The numbers are more probable to be dispersed if the standard deviation is high.



**_Example:_**

6, 8, 12, 14

After adding the given data set, we need to divide them by 4 for an average value of 10

Then all the data set numbers need to be subtracted by the mean, that is, by 10, and after subtraction, all the numbers need to get squared.

=  = 16

=  = 4

=  = 4

=  = 16

After getting the average of all of the numbers, we need to add them together.

Calculate the square root of the last result, which is 10, to get the standard deviation.

Therefore, the standard deviation equals 3.1622776601684.

After we round the answer, we get the result 3.162.



## 5. Conclusion




In this tutorial, we learned what deviation is and its measure and how to calculate them. In this tutorial, we discussed the measures of dispersion in detail. Our next topic will be Measures of shape-skewness.
