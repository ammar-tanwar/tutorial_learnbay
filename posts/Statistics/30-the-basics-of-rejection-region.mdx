# **The Basics of Rejection Region**


## 1. The Summary of Hypothesis testing

 

Hypothesis testing is a fundamental idea in inferential statistics. When assessing whether the claim is correctly accepted or rejected, hypothesis testing is performed by utilizing a sample size. Researchers possess two aspects for doing this kind of testing, the first is one-tailed tests, and the second is two-tailed tests. These two are the key features of the rejection region.

 


## 2. Scope of the tutorial

 


●  	What is the rejection region?


●  	One-tailed test with example.


●  	Two-tailed test with example.


     


## 3. What is the rejection region?

 

In hypothesis testing, the testing method divides all eligible sample results into two subsets. The "acceptance region" is a subset that is considered to be accurate with the null hypothesis, and the "rejection region" is a separate subset (or "critical region").

 

When the sample falls within the acceptable range, the null hypothesis will be accepted. Once the collection reaches the rejection zone, then there is the rejection of the null hypothesis, which suggests the alternative theory has been accepted.

 

Suppose the experimental data fall around a section that is defined as a rejection region (often described as a critical region). The null hypothesis is required to be invalidated under those circumstances. In other words, our outcomes are statistically significant when they come within that range.

 

Analyzing concepts or experimental outcomes is the primary objective of statistics.

 

Example:

There is a store that has formed a brand-new steel plant that they think will produce steel that will be 50% stronger than the competitive steel plant. The experiment's purpose is to show if the theory is true, so it must be able to be repeated, and it should be compared to common steel facts.

 


## 4. One-Tailed Test-Explained

 

The method for figuring out whether the sample means would be higher or lower than the population means is to choose a one-tailed test.

Figure 1: One-Tailed Test

Example:

Assume an analyst is trying to prove that a portfolio manager underperformed an S&P 500 index by 16.91% in a precise year. The alternative (

) and null hypotheses (

) can be placed as:

- The population mean and the sample mean are not the same (null hypothesis)

- The population mean and the sample mean are the same (alternative hypotheses).

The measure that the researcher or analysts attempt to reject the statement is defined as the null hypothesis. The analyst's conclusion that the portfolio manager outperformed the S&P 500 is the alternate hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is supported when the outcome of the one-tailed test rejects the null hypothesis.

In addition, the researcher would examine further portfolio managers' efficiency when the experimental findings would not facilitate the null hypothesis.


## 5. Two-Tailed Test-Explained

When evaluating how the sample mean appears considerably larger or smaller compared to the population mean, then the two-tailed test is applied.

Figure 2: Depicting The Two-Tailed Test Example

An authorized investigation firm's database indicated that the actual mean as well as standard deviation including all ABC broker clients remain at $18 & $6. As an example, suppose a new stock broker,  XYZ, says that their brokerage fees are lower compared to those of the present stockbroker, ABC.

The updated XYZ broker rates have been used to generate brokerage fees corresponding to a sample of 100 ABC clients. While the sample mean equals $18.75 and also the sample standard deviation equals $6, could that be concluded concerning fluctuation throughout the mean broking charge considering brokers ABC & XYZ?

Null Hypothesis (

): mean = 18

Alternative Hypothesis (

): mean &lt;= 18 (we want to demonstrate this)

Rejection region: Z &lt;= - 

 and Z>=

 (When using a 5% significance level, allocate 2.5 to each side)

Z equals the sample mean subtract mean / (std-dev / sqrt (number of values)

equals 18.75 subtract 18 / (6/(sqrt(100) equals 1.25

This estimated Z value comes within the two limits described by:

 = -1.96 and 

 = 1.96

It signifies that there is insufficient data to draw the inference that the fee charged by the current broker and the new broker were different at all. Therefore, the null hypothesis is now dismissed.


## 6. Conclusion

Importantly when a number exceeds the rejection region then that does not always follow that the null hypothesis can be confirmed; instead, this only suggests the existence of inadequate information is used to support its rejection.

This is all about the rejection region. The next topic will be the type of tests.
