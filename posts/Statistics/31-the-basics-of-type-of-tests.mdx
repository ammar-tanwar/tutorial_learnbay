# **The Basics of Type of Tests**


## 1. The Overview of the Tutorial

Statistics is a collections of statistical tests that are applied by analysts for drawing conclusions from the available set of data. Such test results provide us the chance to make decisions depending on the data's observed pattern. 


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is the statistical test?
* When do we perform a statistical test?
* What are the types of statistical tests?


## 3. What is the statistical test?

In statistical methods, the null hypothesis assumes that there is no relationship or difference between the groups. The next step is to determine if the observational data matches the range of values the null hypothesis represents.

The flowchart can be applied to check the statistical test types we have for our data when we are already familiar with the different sorts of variables that we are working with.

## 4. When do we perform statistical tests?

A scientifically reliable method of collecting data, like research or observations made through probability sampling techniques, can be applied to execute statistical tests on data.

The sample size should be appropriate to roughly depict the true distribution of the population under research for a statistical test to be considered valid.


## 5. Types of statistical tests - (1) Parametric statistical test

When the data is normally distributed, parametric tests are applied. A parametric statistical test assumes information on the population elements and the data distributions. These tests, affirmatively accept data from a normal distribution that includes t-tests, z-tests, and ANOVA tests.


### **Z-Test:**

Since the variances are identified and the sample size is high, a z-test is a statistical test that is used to determine if two population means vary from one another. A z-test is a statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large. In the z-test, mean of the population is compared. The parameters used are population mean and population standard deviation. Z-test is used to validate a hypothesis that the sample drawn belongs to the same population.


### **T-Tests:**

The means of the two sourced samples are compared in a t-test. If the population's mean and standard deviation remains unknown, a t-test is conducted.


### **ANOVA Tests:**

ANOVA is a statistical technique used to estimate whether the means of a number of groups vary from one another vastly. ANOVA compares the means of samples obtained for examining the effect of one or more factors. Considering that there are more than two samples, a t-test rather than of an ANOVA test won't generate accurate results.


## 6. Types of statistical tests - (2) Non-parametric statistical tests

Whenever data distribution is not normally distributed, non-parametric tests are performed. Chi-square tests are non-parametric examples.


### **Chi-Square Tests:**

Two categorical variables are analyzed by utilizing the chi-square test. To identify if the observed frequency differed significantly from the estimated frequency, the Chi-Square statistic value should always be calculated and matched to a critical value by the Chi-Square distribution.


**Note: **

T-tests, z-tests, ANOVA tests, and chi-square tests are described in detail in our other tutorials.


## 7. Conclusion

When examining a hypothesis, statistical tests are utilized. It determines how an outcome variable has a statistically significant correlation. An approximate estimation of the variance between two or more groups.

This is all about the type of tests. Our following tutorial will be about type I and type II errors.
