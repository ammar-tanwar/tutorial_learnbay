## 1. The Overview of the Tutorial

A dataset's outliers are really an essential factor. These might comprise important information about our data. Consequently, understanding the importance of identifying outliers in a dataset can enable us to interpret our data more accurately. Outliers can influence statistical outcomes and provide significant perspectives on the data we're examining. Errors and inaccuracies in our data analysis can be detected with this.


## 2. Scope of the Article


* Definition of outliers.


* Causes of outliers.


* How do we treat outliers?


## 3. Definition of Outliers

In a data graph or dataset, we're interacting with, an outlier is a data point that is excessively high or excessively low in comparison to the nearest data point and the majority of the surrounding correlated values.

Outliers are notable features that considerably differ from the dataset's or graph's standard value distribution.

An outlier can be detected in the image shown on the far right.

## 4. Causes of Outliers


It's important to be aware of the reasons for the outliers before dealing with this issue. It can be caused by data Data entry/experiment measurement issues, sample errors, and characteristic variance. These are the three main causes of outliers.


### 
1.    Data entry /An experimental measurement error

When conducting tests or inputting data, errors are possible. A typist, during data entry, might mistakenly type the incorrect value. Let's have a look at a dataset of ages in which we observed that a person's age is 356, and that is unreasonable. Consequently, this represents an entry mistake.


### 2. Sampling problems

Random sample gathering could result in outliers. Let's examine an example in which there are records of the bone density of different health types, but one health type has an odd growth of bone, and after researching this, it was observed that the individual had diabetes, which affects the health of the bones.


### 3. Natural characteristic variance

Let's assume we need to analyze a machine's durability. Standard materials, manufacturing environments, and circumstances are all elements of typical production. A power cut or a mechanical configuration can deviate from the specific value throughout a portion of the study, which could impact the products. Certain unexpected production circumstances might create products with abnormal strength levels, which can lead to outliers. In conclusion, it is appropriate for us to remove such data points from our dataset.


## 5. How do we treat outliers?

The values that are lying on the whiskers are known as outliers.

Whenever the value is going away from the box, the probability that a particular observation is an outlier keeps increasing.

For example:

If I want to fill the data set

5, 5, 5, 5, 5, __, 5

Which value should I put in the blank? It’ll be 5.

And if the data set consists of outliers like

5, 5, 5, 5, 5, __, 5, 2000

Here the value 2000 is an outlier; it'll affect our overall true center and make out data bias. Hence it might be better to drop such values.

Methods for determining an outlier:



* Sorting the data and looking for extreme values
* By data distribution (Boxplot, Scatterplot, etc.)


## 6. Conclusion

With the help of this tutorial, you will now be able to detect outliers and remove them from your dataset. Our following topics will be on the I-QR method.
