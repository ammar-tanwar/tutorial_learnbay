# **The Basics of The Analysis of Covariance**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

By including a quantitative covariate and a categorical treatment variable, analysis of covariance joins components of linear regression and analysis of variance.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* ANCOVA - what is it?
* Example for ANCOVA


## 3. ANCOVA - what is it?

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression are grouped in ANCOVA. Since it could inform us on which additional information can be gained by working on one independent variable (feature) simultaneously while taking the significance of the remaining variables into account.

ANCOVA is used to compare independent groups within the context of a covariate on a continuous outcome.

Figure 1: Use of ANCOVA


**Note:**

All independent levels should have an association between the covariate and the outcome variable that should be comparable in terms of strength and direction.


## 4. Example for ANCOVA

_Conducting ANCOVA in SPSS._



1. Between-subjects received data is applied to record the data.
2. Press the Analyze button.
3. Shift the mouse button over the drop-down selection on the General Linear Model.
4. Press the univariate button.
5. For pointing out the continuous outcome variable, select it.
6. To take the variable on the Dependent Variable: field, select the arrow.
7. To point out the categorical predictor variable, press the button for  the keyword "grouping."
8. For moving the variable toward the Fixed Factor(s): box, press the arrow button.
9. When indicating the continuous covariate variable, select it.
10. When changing the variable into the Covariate(s): box, select the arrow.
11. Go to the Options button and click to select.
12. Select the Factor(s) and Factor Interactions: box inside the Estimated Marginal Means.
13. For indicating the categorical predictor variable, select the keyword "grouping."
14. Then shift the variable inside the Display Means for: box, and select the arrow.
15. To select it, press on the box stating "Compare main impacts."
16. When selecting the options of descriptive statistics, effect size estimates, observed power, and homogeneity tests, press enter on each of them.
17. Press continue.
18. Press OK.


### **How to evaluate the ANCOVA outcomes from SPSS**



1. Search for the Sig. column in Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances. This is how the p-value is evaluated.
* Researchers either should check for outliers or utilize non-parametric tests when our p-value comes LESS THAN.05. 
* When we get this scenario then it means the assumption has been broken.
* We have met the assumption, consequently, we can take the research further when the p-value is MORE THAN.05.
2. Search for the Sig. column inside the Tests of Between-Subjects Effects section. Here are the p-values that are evaluated. Let us begin by considering the row constituting the covariate variable.
* We find the covariate remarkably modifies the relationship between the predictor and outcome variable when our p-value comes LESS THAN.05.
* The covariate will NOT modify the relationship between the predictor and outcome variable when our p-value comes GREATER THAN.05.
3. Search for the p-value of the categorical predictor or "grouping" number.
* The statistically significant distinction between the groups or extent of the variable is decided when the p-value came LESS THAN.05.
* There was no statistically significant difference between the groups or levels of the variable if the p-value was MORE THAN.05.
4. Researchers have proved the statistically significant distinction that we get from amongst the groups or extent at the time we control the covariate when both the "grouping" or predictor variable and the covariate were considerable.
* The ANCOVA has shown that it does not correct the relationship when the covariate is significant however the "grouping" or predictor variable is not.

When the covariate is not significant however our "grouping" or predictor variable is, then the covariate will have no effect on the relationship that we have between the predictor and the outcome variable.


## 5. Conclusion

When utilizing ANCOVA, our covariate variable should be exact and correct enough to properly modify for the difference related to the association that the predictor and outcome variable consists of.

This is all about ANCOVA. Our following topic will be data wrangling.
