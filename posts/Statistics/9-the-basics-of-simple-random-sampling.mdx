## 1. Overview of the Tutorial

Simple random sampling is done by selecting values from a population and adding a series of values to every item. If the sample doesn't always correctly reflect the population it is meant to represent; it's possible that there was a sampling error.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial 

●  	In this tutorial, we will understand what simple random sampling is.

●  	We will learn how to conduct a simple random sampling.

●  	We will learn simple random techniques.


## 3. Simple Random Sampling-What does it mean?

A subgroup of a statistical population called a simple random sample is a group in which all members have an equal likelihood of being chosen. A basic random sample is meant to accurately represent a group.

Simple random sampling is the simplest method for selecting a study sample from a larger population.

Researchers can categorize a specific group and eliminate bias by using basic random sampling. Without carrying out a survey or collecting data from every person in the population, statistical techniques are able to draw conclusions and make predictions about the population.


## 4. Is there any drawback to simple random sampling?

This method has a number of drawbacks, like problems in selecting participants who can be selected from a broader population, increased processing times, increased costs, and the chance of bias in some situations.

Although simple random sampling is supposed to be unbiased, sample selection bias can exist. The coverage of the total population is skewed when a sample set obtained from a larger population is not broad enough, thus demanding the use of more sampling techniques.

## 5. Steps to Conduct a Simple Random Sampling

### 1.    Defining the population:


    In this phase, we identify the huge population and confirm that it will fully cover the result we are trying to calculate.

### 2.    Selecting the sample size:


    We should first select the units to choose from a population before picking the individual units. According to the amount of time, financial limitations, or even other resources used to assess the sample, this sample size may be increased or reduced.

### 3.    Determining population units:


Making the full list of each item in our population is needed in this phase.




### 4.    Assigning numerical values:


It is not important how the values are allocated; what concerns it is that each value is sequential and has an equal probability of being chosen.




### 5.    Selecting Random Values:


    In this step, we randomly select numbers from the population.

### 6.    Identifying Sample:


    Identifying which random values were obtained and which population item's respective values match helps with the selection of the sample.

## 6. Random Sampling Techniques

The researcher might select from the following techniques: 
 _1._    _Random Lottery_
 _2._    _Physical Methods_
 _3._    _Random Number Table_
 _4._    _Online Random Number Generator_
 _5._    _Random numbers from excel_

## 7. Simple Random Sampling example

A simple random sample will include 25 employees' names picked at random from a group of 250 employees.

The lottery approach is at work in a situation where 25 employees' names are picked at random from a group of 250. After allocating a number between 1 and 250 to each of the 250 employees, 25 of such numbers might be picked at random.

Each participant of the large population set has the same possibility of being chosen since the participants who make up the selection of the larger group are picked at random.

## 8. Conclusion

With simple random sampling, every item in the population has the same likelihood of being selected for the sample size when examining a population. It is possible to create this simpler sampling technique to establish more advanced sampling techniques.

This is all about the basics of simple random sampling. Our next topic will be systematic sampling.
