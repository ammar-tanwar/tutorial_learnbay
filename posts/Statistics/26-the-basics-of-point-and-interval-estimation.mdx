**The Basics of Point and Interval Estimation**

## 1. The overview of The Tutorial


We can obtain point and interval estimates about the population with descriptive and inferential statistics. To obtain an accurate representation of where a parameter is most likely to lie, these types of estimations are important.

 

## 2. Scope of the tutorial


 


●  	What is estimation?


●  	Types of estimation with examples?


●  	What are point estimation and interval estimation?

## 3. What is estimation?


 

A method, equation, or function described as an estimator clearly explains how to calculate an estimate. In other words, we can use data from the sample in the form of an estimator to predict the estimate of the population parameter.

Calculating the extent of an effect and summarizing the effect size and its confidence interval are the key objectives of estimating techniques.

 


### Note:

The topic of the confidence interval will be covered in our next tutorial.

 

## 4. Types of Estimation



  1.    Point Estimates

To identify the most likely value of the related unknown population parameter, a point estimate is a sample statistic obtained by using the data samples. To put it differently, a point estimate is a single data point calculated from a sample and assigned to determine the value of the population.

  Figure 1:Point Estimate

To estimate the population's mean, for example, we might utilize a value of x̅.

x̅ = Σx/n

For example, the mean score of the entire class is 62, which represents the average (x̅) mark attained by a sample of 15 students picked randomly from a class of students who enrolled. It is a point estimator since it has only one numeric form.



1. Interval Estimates

In statistics, an interval is a group of frequencies. The procedure of interval estimate consists of calculating an interval of predicted values for an unknown population parameter with sample data.

  Figure 2: Interval Estimate

**Example:**

Suppose we are seeking to find out how often seniors smoke. Due to time and financial restrictions, we can't survey all seniors in the world, therefore we select a sample of 1000 and learn that 10% of seniors smoke. We can use the figure to conclude that "approximately" 10% of the overall population smokes cigarettes, regardless of the fact that we have only selected a sample. Since we only sampled a small sample of the population, it's improbable that the exact percentage will be approximately 10%, but it's more likely to be anywhere between 5% and 15%. This interval estimate of "anywhere between 5% and 15%" must be used.

 

## 5. Conclusion


 

The 2 categories of population parameter estimation categories are based on sample data that are point estimates and interval estimates. Determining point estimates are very simple. A significantly more useful and accurate technique compared to the point estimate is the interval estimate.

This is all about point and interval estimation. Our following topic will be the confidence interval.
