# **The Basics of Data Preprocessing**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

In this article, I will be discussing how data preprocessing is the most important step by which you should have a better comprehension of the idea of how data preprocessing changes the data into a format that can be used for data mining and other data science tasks more quickly and efficiently.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Data Preprocessing-Explanation
* Tools and Methodologies for Preprocessing Data
* What do the data preparation strategic operations consist of?


## 3. Data Preprocessing-Explained

Any type of processing done on raw data to get it ready for another data processing action is referred to as data preprocessing, which is a subset of data preparation. It has been an important first step in the data mining process. 

Data preprocessing transforms the data into an easy format. This easy format can be processed more rapidly and effectively for data mining. Statistics and other data science applications also use this effective way of data mining. These techniques are the very beginning of development providing us with accurate results. 


## 4. Tools and Methodologies for Preprocessing Data

Preprocessing data includes several tools that help to perform these methods that we need to select when we represent a subset of data that we receive from the population of the data.



* _Transformation:_ To create a single input. It converts raw data;
* _Denoising:_ which removes noise from data;
* _Imputation:_ It replaces missing values with a synthesis of statistically significant data.
* _Normalization:_ It is the process of organizing data to make it easier to access; and
* _Feature extraction:_ The process of determining which feature subset is important in a particular situation.

Streaming data, data saved in files or databases, and other types of data sources can all be processed using these tools and techniques.


## 5. What do the data preparation strategic operations consist of?



1. Data Profiling: Examining, appraising, and analyzing data to generate statistics on its quality is the step of data profiling.
2. Data Cleansing: Here, the objective is to determine the most straightforward approach to dealing with quality issues, such as deleting erroneous data, filling in data gaps, or generally ensuring that the raw data is suitable for feature engineering.

**Note:**


Data cleaning will be covered in detail in our next tutorial.



3. Data reduction: Using data reduction techniques like principal component analysis, the raw data is simplified into a format that is probably more suited for various use cases.
4. Data transformation: It entails actions like organizing unstructured data, integrating relevant variables when it makes sense, or choosing significant ranges to concentrate on.
5. Data enrichment: The different feature engineering libraries are applied by data scientists in this step to adjust the data as needed.
6. Data validation: The information is currently divided into two sets. Artificial intelligence or deep learning model is trained using the first set. Data used for testing make up the second collection.

## 6. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we found the vital significance that data preprocessing plays in the initial phases of the development of applications. We learned how data preprocessing is used to improve the way data is cleaned, sorted, and organized. Also, we found it improves the accuracy by reducing the amount of computing done.

This is all about data preprocessing. Our following topic will be data cleaning.
