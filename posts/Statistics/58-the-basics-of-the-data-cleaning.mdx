# **The Basics of The Data Cleaning**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

One might not elaborate on the significance of acquiring clean and reliable data for any statistical research. The researchers might be fascinated by the approach's difficulty or beauty in real-world applications. However, the data by itself might be imperfect and might generate results that recommend actions without sufficient justification.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Data cleansing-Explained
* Framework for Cleaning Data
* Stages for Data cleansing


## 3. Data cleansing-Explained

The process of eliminating inaccurate data points from a dataset is known as "cleaning."

Using a theory or hypothesis concerning the type of data, various analyses attempt to detect a pattern in a set of data. The procedure of "cleaning" comprises erasing any data points that include either:

(a) According to a different factor that only belongs to such specific data points, the consequence or hypothesis that we are intending to remove is visibly omitted.

(b) Clearly improper, i.e, Several existing errors are displayed in that specific information point, either as an outcome of an error throughout data collection, presentation, etc.

We discard these relevant data points throughout the approach and emphasize our assessment on the collected information instead.


**Note:**

'Cleaning' commonly comprises human judgment to select what points are correct and which are not, even though there is a probability that normal data points are produced by some influence not properly accounted for in the hypothesis/assumption supporting the analytical approach utilized.


## 4. Framework for Cleaning Data

The cleaned data points are commonly extreme outliers. "Outliers" are reference points that stand since they don't usually match a pattern that becomes apparent in the data. Plotting the data points and directly evaluating the generated plot for points that sit far away from the general distribution these were the two main methods for detecting outliers.

The alternative approach is to perform the analysis on the entire data, delete any points that fail to match the statistical "control limits" for pattern variability, and then run the analysis again using the remaining data.


## 5. Stages for Data cleansing


### **Identify and sort out missing data:**

Data scientists must choose at this stage whether it is preferable to delete records with missing data, ignore them, or fill them up with a likely value. 


### **Reduce noisy data:**

An analytical data model may be distorted by the noise present in real-world data. A temperature sensor that routinely recorded 75 degrees Fahrenheit would inadvertently record a temperature of 250 degrees. 


### **Identify and remove duplicates: **

An algorithm must decide whether two recordings representing the same event or different events were recorded when they appear to repeat. There could occasionally be minute variations in a record because one field was entered erroneously.


## 6. Conclusion

In my opinion, a professional statistician or analyst devotes 90% of their hours to obtaining and cleaning data, establishing hypotheses that compensate for as many external generalized factors as possible, and just 10% of the time simply modifying the data statistically and coming to conclusions.

This is all about data cleaning. Our following tutorial will be restructuring the data.
