**The Basics of Central Limit Theorem**

## 1. The Tutorial’s Summary


The central limit theorem encourages us to anticipate that the sampling distribution of the mean would be normally distributed throughout handling high amounts of information. It improves statistical inference and makes analysis easy.

 

## 2. The Tutorial's Objectives

  ●  	Central limit theorem-Definition


  ●  	What are the applications of the central limit theorem?


  ●  	Calculation of the central limit theorem.


   

## 3. Central limit theorem-Definition




According to central limit theorem (CLT) of probability and statistics, the spread from a sample set of data incorporates a normal distribution which is a "bell curve" as all the volume increases, supposing that the data points are of equivalent size and despite of the general populations' overall distribution shape.

As per the central limit theorem (CLT), the mean from all measured variables inside the same population should be approximately equal to the mean of the selected population for reasonably large samples taken from a larger population having a specified amount of variance.

In accordance with the law of large numbers, these data points also reflect a normal distribution, having their variances almost equaling the variation of the population as the sample size expands.



## 4. What are the applications of the central limit theorem?




Despite how the data are distributed, the central limit theorem indicates that as sample sizes expand, the sampling distribution will get closer to the mean of the overall population itself. In another aspect, the data is reliable irrespective of the distribution's normality or irregularity.

Usually, sample sizes over 30 and 50 are regarded to be acceptable for the CLT to apply; this signifies that the distribution of the sample means is approximately normally distributed. For huge sample sizes (n30), the central limit theorem is appropriate.

**Note:**

The central limit theorem is also applied in _hypothesis testing_ and _regression analysis_ which we will discuss in our following tutorial.



## 5. Calculation method of the central limit theorem.



*The formula for the central limit theorem:*


  x=

and


 x=n

Where

μ is Population mean

σ is Population standard deviation



 x is Sample mean

is Sample standard deviation  

n = Sample size

**Example:**

The distribution of male population weight data is normally distributed. The mean weight and standard deviations are 15 and 70 kg. Let us see what the sample's mean and standard deviation were when the study had taken into consideration the records of 50 males.

Population’s mean μ = 70 kg

Population’s standard deviation = 15kg

n sample size equals 50

The mean value of the sample data set is evaluated as

x=70 kg

The sample's standard deviation is determined as

=n

=1550   

=2.122=2.1kg (approximately)

## 6. Conclusion


The central limit theorem's smallest sample is 30 since this is a sample size that is commonly applied in statistics. A sample size of 30 often improves the confidence interval of the population data set to the extent that it allows for the denials of the assumptions.

The central limit theorem is discussed in detail in this tutorial. Our following topic will be on point and interval estimates.
