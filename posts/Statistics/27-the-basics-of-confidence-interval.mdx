**The Basics of Confidence Interval**

## 1. The overview of The Tutorial


Statisticians apply confidence intervals to measure a sample variable's uncertainty level. Confidence intervals are often involved in regression analysis and hypothesis testing. Statisticians widely use P-values with confidence intervals to calculate statistical significance.




### Note:

Regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and p-value will be discussed in our following topic.



## 2. Scope of The Tutorial





●  Defining confidence interval?


●  Application of confidence interval


●  Calculating a confidence interval for the population parameter

## 3. Defining confidence interval?




A confidence interval from statistics indicates the possibility that a population proportion will, towards a particular percentage of the duration, range between a set of numbers. Confidence intervals that can include 95% or 99% of predicted observations are commonly in use by analysts. However, whenever a point estimate near 10.00 is generated using only a statistical approach having a 95% confidence interval that ranges from 9.50 - 10.50, it could be determined that there would be a 95% possibility that often the true value falls inside that range.



## 4. Application of confidence interval




Confidence intervals have been typically utilized by numerous statisticians to estimate the actual degree of uncertainty in a different sampling variable. For example, to establish how each sample will correctly represent the actual value of the population variable, a study will utilize many random samples taken from the same population and find a confidence interval for each sample. All the obtained datasets are different; some intervals include the real population parameter, whereas others do not.



## 5. Calculating a confidence interval for the population parameter



Consider a group of researchers researching high school basketball players' heights. The average height that the study estimates using a random population sampling is 74 inches.



The mean of the population is predicted to be 74 inches, on average. A point estimate on its own is not very useful as it tries to hide the estimate's uncertainty associated, giving us very little concept of how far this 74-inch sample means will deviate from the population mean. The uncertainty level throughout this sample is what is missing.

Point estimates miss additional information that confidence intervals provide. The statisticians calculate a 95% confidence interval utilizing the sample's mean and standard deviation, simultaneously retaining the bell-shaped normal distribution that reaches a bottom and top bound, which, in 95% of the case, indicates the true mean.

Figure 1: Confidence Interval

Imagine the interval is within the range of 72 to 76 inches. Throughout 95 of its 100 random selections collected from the population of high school basketball participants, the mean must range around 72 as well as 76 inches.



The interval can sometimes be expanded to 99% confidence when the researchers require additional confidence. Enabling more sample often means eventually resulted in a wider range. Researchers might predict that 99 of every 100 samples examined will result in a mean value that comes within the 99% confidence interval, which will be around 70- 78 inches.



On the contrast side, a 90% confidence level indicates that we might assume 90% of the interval predictions to include the population parameter and vice versa.



## 6. Conclusion



Confidence intervals are widely misunderstood to measure the percentage of data collected from a sample that exists only between upper and lower bounds. In other respects, it would therefore be wrong to imply that a random sample size must, on average, come within the boundaries of a 99% confidence interval. Instead, it suggests that there is a 99% possibility that the distribution will include the population mean.

This is all about the confidence interval. Our next topic will be Z-distribution.
