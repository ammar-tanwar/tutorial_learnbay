# **The Basics of The Addition of Matrices**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

 A matrix refers to a rectangle-shaped array of letters, equations, or integers ordered in rows and columns in mathematics. We can perform different mathematical techniques with these matrices. Let's explore its explanation and application by using examples.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is matrix addition?
* Understanding matrix addition.
* Example of the matrix addition.


## 3. What is matrix addition?

The joining of two maybe more matrices is characterized by matrix addition. In comparison to adding numbers mathematically, matrix addition would respond to different regulations. Before the addition, the matrices should be placed in the same order. Now let us quickly review what matrices need before moving toward the addition of the matrix.

Vertical Columns are represented by "n," whereas Horizontal Rows are defined by "m." Therefore, a matrix m x n has m and n, accordingly, as the total number of rows and columns. We are therefore familiar with several other sorts of matrices, that include square, row, null, diagonal, scalar, identity, diagonal, triangular matrices, and others.


## 4. Understanding Matrix Addition

The fundamental procedure used to combine two or more matrices is called addition. However, when the given matrices are arranged in the same order then the matrices get added. By regularity, we indicate that every matrix contains the same amount of rows and columns. Therefore, as a result, we can connect the matching matrix components.

On the other hand, matrix addition is prohibited when the order is mismatched. If two matrices of order m x n, A = 

and B = 

, are considered, the addition of A and B is defined by;

A+B = 

+ 

=

By referring to the simple idea of adding algebraic expressions, we observe that while adding algebraic expressions is only possible achieved by adding similar components, adding two matrices can sometimes be performed by adding matching terms in the matrices.

The addition of a matrix is determined by practically just two components. These are what they are:



1. Let us consider matrices A and B. When only if the order of the matrices is equal, i. e., when the two matrices include the same number of rows and columns, therefore these matrices can be added. Suppose matrix A, for instance, belongs to the order

	3 x 4,

assuming that the order of B is also given, matrix B might be added                        to matrix A.

	3 x 4



2. For matrices of various sizes, addition is not prescribed.


## 5. Examples of matrix addition

Adding matrices in various patterns.

Where A =

and B =

While A's order is 2 by 2, and B's order is 3 by 2, the A+B matrix cannot be constructed. Consequently, matrices A and B cannot be added.


## 6. Conclusion

In this course, we learned how to add matrices using fundamental operations. This is all about the addition of matrices. Our following topic will be scalar multiplication.
