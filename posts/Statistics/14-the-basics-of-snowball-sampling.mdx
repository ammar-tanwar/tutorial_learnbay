# **The Basics of Snowball Sampling**

 


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

 

We can conduct research on populations that we couldn't possibly access without the help of snowball sampling. The techniques of snowball sampling make it simple and affordable to collect a sample. Snowball sampling is flexible as all we need to do is locate one individual who will introduce us to other people and participate.

 


## 2. Scope of the Tutorial

 


●  	What is snowball sampling?


●  	How is snowball sampling performed?


●  	When is snowball sampling used?

 


## 3. Definition of snowball sampling.

 

A non-probability sampling method is called snowball sampling, which comprises recruiting new units by present units to make up the sample. Inquiry about individuals with specific characteristics that would be hard to find otherwise can benefit from snowball sampling (e.g., people with a rare disease).

 

Snowball sampling, commonly referred to as chain sampling or network sampling, begins with one or more research participants. Having followed that, it continues according to the suggestions from those participants. This technique is repeated until the required sample is received or a maximum point is reached.

 

Example:

A researcher attempting to study leadership characteristics can ask participants to name other influential people in their community.

## 4. Steps For Performing Snowball Sampling.

 


1. To begin, researchers will pick any potential participants from a population to form an initial sample.

 


2. Regardless of whether only a few subjects are initially identified, the researchers will request those people to recognize more participants for the research. By motivating people to come forward on their own, researchers recruit subjects. Participants in the study will only share the particular identities of those who have been recruited when there's no chance of humiliation or privacy violations. Participants in the research do not tell any other potential participants' names.

 


3. Primary participants will keep recruiting new team members until the sample size needed is attained.

 


## 5. When should we implement a snowball sample?

 

In qualitative research, snowball sampling is a widely used technique, particularly when researching difficult-to-reach populations.


●   Smaller populations in comparison to the entire population.


●  	Populations are scattered out geographically.


●  	Populations with an increased social status or a specific common interest.

In all of these situations, there is no available targeted population, which makes it difficult for non-members to recruit members of the population.

Snowball sampling is very often used in research in specific areas (such as live music) and also in government policy (such as undocumented immigrants) and environmental health (like drug users).

 


## 6. Conclusion

 

Also, sensitive issues or matters that participants might prefer not to speak about in public are researched using this sampling procedure. This is typically drawn on by a curiosity about the chance of self-disclosure. We may approach these populations via snowball sampling while considering moral concerns like protecting confidentiality and maintaining their privacy.

In the next chapter, we will be on judgment sampling.
