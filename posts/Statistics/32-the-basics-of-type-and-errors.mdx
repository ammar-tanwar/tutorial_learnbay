# **The Basics of Type I and Type II Errors**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The potential of generating these errors is inevitable in hypothesis testing since adopting a statistical conclusion generally involves a certain level of uncertainty.

The significance level, or alpha (α), determines the possibility of a Type I error, while the beta (β) states the likelihood of a Type II error. 


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Define statistical decision-making error.
* Define null hypothesis.
* Define type I error.
* Define type II error.


## 3. Statistical Decision-Making Error

We consider whether the null hypothesis could be rejected using the data and the outputs of a statistical test. Reaching a wrong decision is always likely as these decisions are made based on probabilities.

When the data contain statistical significance, it indicates that regardless of whether the null hypothesis is correct, they are highly improbable to occur. We would therefore reject our null hypothesis under this circumstance. However often, this could be a Type I error.

When our data are not statistically significant, the null hypothesis is most likely correct and it has a high probability of occurring. As a result, our null hypothesis is not rejected. However, sometimes, it could be a Type II error.


## 4. Defining Null Hypothesis

A sentence that invalidates the opposition with evidence is considered to be a null hypothesis. Take a look at these instances:

Example 1

_Hypothesis_ - Cavities are avoided on teeth with toothpaste that has got water added to it.

_Null Hypothesis_ - Toothpaste that has got water added to it has no effect on the cavities of the teeth.

Example 2

_Hypothesis_ - Cavities are avoided on teeth with toothpaste that has got floride added to it.

_Null Hypothesis_ - Toothpaste that has got floride added to it has no effect on the cavities of the teeth.

Here, the null hypothesis needs to be validated in against the experimental data for nullifying the effects of water and floride on tooth cavities.


## 5. Defining Type I Error

In example 1 the null hypothesis is true. Here It is correct to say that when water is added to toothpaste it has no effect on preventing cavities. However, when we observe an effect of water addition on cavities while using the experimental data then at that point we are rejecting the actual null hypothesis. 

Such an error is known as a type I error which is also known as a _false positive condition_ where we get a situation indicating that a given condition is present but it actually is not present. The likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis regardless of whether it is true acts as a reference for the Type I error rate or significance level of Type I.

Alpha level, commonly called a type I error, is denoted by the symbol (α) A Type I error significance level of 0.05 or 5% is generally acceptable, signifying that a 5% possibility of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is allowable.


## 6. Defining Type II Error

In example 2 the null hypothesis is false. Here the null hypothesis is incorrect because the addition of floride in toothpaste helps in preventing cavities. However, when utilizing experimental data, we do not observe an effect of floride put on cavities, then we are adopting a false null hypothesis.

This error is of type II and is also known as a _false positive condition_ where a situation indicates that a given condition is not present but it actually is present. 

Beta (β), commonly known as beta level, indicates a type II error. A statistical test's purpose is to determine whether or not the null hypothesis can be rejected. A statistical test can or cannot reject the null hypothesis. 

The following table shows the connection between the null hypothesis' truth or falsehood and the test's outcome in terms of Type I or Type II error.

## 7. Conclusion

Recognizing error rates and significance levels is fundamental for using hypothesis testing appropriately as they help us to manage error rates to achieve our requirement.

This is all about the type I and type II errors. Our following topic will be on the P-value method.
