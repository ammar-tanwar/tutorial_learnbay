## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The non-probability sampling technique of quota sampling is most likely to properly describe the entire population.

Generally, quota sampling is a successful method for gathering samples. Quota sampling is faster and simpler than other approaches since it does not demand mandatory random sample procedures or a sampling frame.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* In this tutorial, we will learn what quota sampling is.
* Where is it used?
* How is it performed? 


## 3. Definition of Quota Sampling

A non-probability sampling technique called quota sampling relies on the non-random selection of a particular number or percentage of units.

The population is usually divided into independently exclusive groups, or "strata," and then sample units are collected until the quota is met. These units share particular characteristics that we selected to set while creating the strata.

## 4. When is the Quota Sampling applied?

Quota sampling is applied in qualitative and quantitative research to know further about a particular subgroup's features of qualitative and quantitative research methods to learn more about a certain subgroup's characteristics or to study relations among them.

Since it can assist researchers to obtain a sample obtaining a sample that is as representative of the subject being researched as possible, it is most frequently utilized in investigations where there is no targeted population available.


## 5. Discussing how to implement quota sampling with an example.

Quota sampling, in comparison to probability sampling techniques, does not rely on researchers to follow the performance in addition or a random selection procedure. Still, there are several broad principles to take into account.

A quota sample can be generated in three steps which are as follows:


### **Dividing the Population into Strata:**

We should begin by determining important strata and subgroups among our target population. Elements can only belong to one of these subgroups, suggesting that they must be mutually exclusive.

**Example for forming strata:**

Suppose that we are researching the interests of students at the university in terms of careers.

We can pick students of different class years, subjects, or any other characteristics for the stratification relying on our research aim.

Our strata are the various programs as we decide to investigate the difference throughout majors (e.g., economics, engineering, education).


### **Determining a quota for each stratum:**

We established quotas for each population strata by calculating the numbers for each. This calculation may be based on US records, like administrative data, or earlier research. Therefore, we are free to make our own decisions regarding the number of units we should select from each subgroup to get accurate results.

Example:

We decided to examine the career aspirations of students studying economics and all of those looking for education. The percentage of diploma students in economics and education to the overall enrollment in these courses can be used to calculate how many students from each diploma to add to our sample.

For example, our sample should include 40% of education students and 60% of economics students assuming that there are 2,000 university students enrolled in the courses, of which 800 are in education and 1,200 are in economics.

Assuming that we want a sample of 100 students, there has to be a ratio of 40 students who are studying education and 60 studying economics.

Note that we can create significant subcategories in our quotas. For example, We must meet our quota of 40 education students including an ideal combination of undergraduate and graduate students. We would select 20 undergraduate and 20 graduate students unless the ratio was 50/50.

We had already given weight to different features within a target population and evaluated their representation in our study by dividing our quota into groups.


### **Until the quota for each stratum is met, continue recruiting:**

When you have determined the number of units we need in each subgroup,  keep recruiting units to enroll in our study until all of our quotas are met.

Example:

After we have recruited 40 education majors, we must stop recruiting and concentrate only on getting into 60 economics majors.


## 6. Conclusion

Selecting who or what constitutes our sample is the purpose of quota sampling. The ideas could:



* Reconstruct the actual statistics of the target population.
* However when population numbers are different, repeated surveys of a specific type of respondent.

 Our following tutorial will be on quota sampling
