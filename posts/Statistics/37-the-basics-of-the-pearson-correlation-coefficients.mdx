# **The Basics of the Pearson Correlation Coefficients.**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The extent of the relationship between two variables, factors, or data points is measured through correlation coefficients in both science and finance. As the tutorial continues, we will explore what correlation and coefficient are and how we use them.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What Is the Correlation Coefficient?
* What Is the Pearson Coefficient?
* Understanding the Pearson Coefficient
* Coefficient of Correlation With The Formula
* How to Calculate the correlation coefficient of Pearson’s r With Example: 


## 3. What Is the Correlation Coefficient?

A statistical estimate of the degree of a linear relationship between the two variables is the correlation coefficient. Its frequencies could range between -1 and 1. Numbers in one column rise while those in the other decline, and vice versa, as indicated by a correlation coefficient of 1, that further denotes a perfect negative or reversed relationship. A coefficient of one denotes a correlation or absolutely positive relation. No linear connection exists when such a correlation coefficient is 0.


## 4. What Is the Pearson Coefficient?

A subtype of correlation coefficient referred to as the Pearson coefficient displays the relationship between the two variables examined on the same ratio or interval scale. The influence of the relation between two continuous variables is assessed by the Pearson coefficient. 


## 5. Understanding the Pearson Coefficient.

The two variables are presented on a scatter plot to estimate the Pearson coefficient, frequently referred to as the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Both X and Y are applied to describe the variables. A scatter plot that is unable to display any relation to a linear relationship will be irrelevant for determining the coefficient. The frequency of correlation is directly correlated with the scatter plot's close to a straight line.

Figure 1: Correlation coefficient 

The Pearson coefficient usually ranges between -1 to +1 and is indicated numerically like how the correlation coefficient is utilized in linear regression. A 100% positive relationship involving two or more variables generates a value of 1. If two variables have a such positive correlation, then they are moving together in the same direction. A result of -1, in contrast, signifies a 100% negative association. Inverse connections are represented by negative correlations, which further suggests that although one variable improves, another falls. 0 represents that there is no correlation.


## 6. Coefficient of Correlation With The Formula

The coefficient of correlation represents the most standard formula for estimating correlation:

This technique is most regularly utilized to calculate the correlation coefficient across two variables. We divide the covariance for two variables by the total of respective standard deviations to achieve the correlation coefficient.


## 7. How to calculate the correlation coefficient of Pearson's r With Example

Example:

The table below outlines the calculations needed for r. 

The sum of the results of the right-most line is 2.969848.

Having a total of four points i.e, 4 – 1 = 3

The sum of the result is divided by 3,

After performing all these steps we get the correlation coefficient of r = 2.969848/3 = 0.989949.

**Note:**

Numerous statistical approaches, such as the Pearson coefficient, the chi-squared test, the p-value, and linear regression, are contributed to English mathematician and statistician Karl Pearson.


## 8. Conclusion

What we learned so far in this tutorial is, that correlation reflects the relationship and how they are related. Correlation is not affected by the change in scale and this is the reason we prefer it. The use of correlation is not only restricted to statistics it is also used in python. 

This is all about the correlation coefficient. Our following topic will be statistical significance.
