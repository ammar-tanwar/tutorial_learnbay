# **The Basics of The Dot product**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll go through precise detail about the dot product of vectors, as well as its explanation, distinct formulas, and demonstration.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Understanding Dot Product
* Formula-Dot Product 
* Dot Product Geometry-Definition
* Dot Product-Algebra Definition


## 3. Understanding Dot Product

Following is the main two multiple methods to multiply a vector: scalar product or dot product, that generates a scalar result, as well as vector product or cross product, that further produces a vector output. 

The scalar product including the 2 different vectors is referenced to as the dot product of two vectors. It refers to a scalar value that would be constructed by executing a specified procedure toward the multiple scalars. 

Only sets of vectors that have an identical quantity of dimensions may utilize the dot product. The dot product is usually denoted by including a thick dot for its symbol. Physics as well as mathematics generally make significant applications of this dot product.

**Note:**

_Two vectors might be multiplied by applying the dot product, generally described as the scalar product._

x.y represents the dot product from two separate vectors that are non-zero and is computed as follows:

x.y =xy cos θ

where its angle generated by x & y is represented by θ, and,

0 ≤ θ ≤ π

When either x equals 0 or y = 0,

then θ would be undefinable

therefore in this scenario,

x.y =0


### **Formula**

We have two distinct approaches for determining the dot product of two vectors: geometrically as well as algebraically.


## 4. Geometrically 

With its geometric formulation, the dot product from given pair vectors a and b are described by:

x.y =|x||y| cos θ

Therefore, |x| and |y| has been defined as the magnitudes of the x and y vectors, whereas θ is the angle seen between x and y vectors.

Therefore cos 90 equals 0, x.y equals 0 when the two vectors are orthogonal, or when the angle betweenthem is 90.

Since cos 0 equals 1, when the two vectors remain parallel, 

x.y =|x||y|.


## 5. Algebraically 

The provided two products' dot products, in accordance with the dot product algebra, are:

– x = (

, 

, 

) and y = (

, 

, 

) is given by:

x.y= (

 + 

 + 

)


## 6. Example For The Dot Product

Trying to calculate the dot product of the values x= (1, 2, 3), and y= (4, -5, 6).

Needs to make sure the vectors should construct an angle.

Applying the dot products' formula,

x.y = (

 + 

 + 

)

and determine the dot product with using

= 1(4) + 2(−5) + 3(6)

= 4 − 10 + 18

= 12

We could assume that both vectors should construct an acute angle considering x.y having a positive quantity.


## 7. Conclusion

A measure having both magnitude and direction would be a vector. Merely a few arithmetic operations, including addition or multiplication, could also be used for vectors. There could be 2 main approaches for multiplication vectors: dot product and cross product. The summing of the products of the respective characteristics of 2 different vectors' dots is referred to as the dot product. It refers to the result of multiplying individual magnitudes through the cosine of its angle at where they are aligned. The square from a vector's magnitude would be the dot product of its vector on itself.

This is all about dot product.
