# **The Basics of Using Z-Scores to find Outliers**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

A Z-score method is a measurement that determines how near a value corresponds to the mean from the dataset.. Due to this property of Z-score, it is one of the methods to find outliers.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Applying Z-scores to find the  Outliers
* Application of Z-Score in a dataset


## 3. Applying Z-scores For Finding Outliers

If our data match the normal distribution, Z-scores can be applied to measure how rare an occurrence is. Z-scores are each range of numbers' standard deviations both above and below the mean. For example, in this case, an observation with a Z-score of 2 has to be two standard deviations beyond the mean, however, one that has a Z-score of -2 is two standard deviations under the mean. A number similar to the mean possesses a Z-score equal to zero.

To obtain the actual measurement, take out the mean, as well as divide through the standard deviation to obtain the Z-score into an observation. The equation for this kind of process is as indicated in mathematical concepts:


The observation is very uncommon and farther is Z-score might be from zero. Z-scores ranging +/-3 or more compared to zero are therefore a standard lower limit when finding outliers. The distribution of Z-scores throughout a regular normal distribution appears in the probability distribution following. Z-scores bigger than +/- 3 will be so extreme that the coloring underlying the curve would hardly be noticeable.

Figure 1: Z-score in the normal distribution

Z-score results larger than +/- 3 and therefore has a frequency of 0.0027 (2 * 0.00135) inside a population including normal distribution, or about 1 in 370 occurrences. Therefore, this procedure may have not been appropriate when our data would not represent the normal distribution.


**Note:**

For more detailed information of the z-score read our z-score tutorial.

Application of Z-Score in a dataset

The example dataset's numbers as well as Z-scores within the example sample is seen below. The same sample is detected as an outlier using the same method.

Since the maximum Z-score is constrained around (n1) / √ n, it is necessary to know how Z-scores could be unreliable with smaller datasets. 

Our Z-score of ~3.6 would actually be close to the maximum limit for every sample size of 15. Z-scores cannot be bigger than a cut-off score of +/-3 for datasets having 10 or fewer occurrences.

As we discovered earlier, the outlier allows the mean and standard deviation to increase, which makes the Z-scores to be inaccurate. Consider how each of the Z-scores—aside from the value from the outlier—are negative. Without including the outlier, we have just estimated Z-scores that are distinct. Be careful that Z-values are modified to become less important when the data consists of outliers (i.e., closer to zero).


## 4. Conclusion

The Z-score method enables statisticians and analysts to determine if a score falls within the standard for a specific data set or differs from it. Analysts can also change scores from several sets of data with Z-scores to obtain scores that are more precisely similar to one another.

This is all about using the z-score for finding outliers. Our following topic will be bivariate analysis.
