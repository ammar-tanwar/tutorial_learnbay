# The Basics of The Scatter Plots


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The plots show the overall relationship between the variables in the given dataset usually known as scatter plots. This displays sets of data based on either a Cartesian system or the two-dimensional plane. The X-axis is applied to explain the independent variable as well as the attribute, whereas the Y-axis is utilized to plot the dependent variable. 


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is a Scatter Plot?
* When do we use a Scatter Plot?
* Example For Scatter Plot
* Elements of The Scatter Plots


## 3. What is a Scatter Plot?

Alternative term for the scatter plot is the XY graph, scatter chart or scattergram. The scatter diagram shows the connection between combinations of numeric values by visualizing those with a variable one for each axis. Therefore everything should determine when and where to apply the scatter plot.


**Note:**

These scatter plots are depicted with the help of graphs or maps that are designed to represent these plots.


## 4. When do we use a Scatter Plot?

The following factors might be required for the application of scatter plots.



* During the scenario of linked numeric values.
* To visualize the specific effect of an independent variable over a dependent variable.
* While assessing the relationship among the variables, it would be essential to find potential problem-solving factors, see how much two products that become linked have the same root problem, and so forth.


## 5. Example For Scatter Plot

The following is an example of a scatterplot that represents the quiz score and mid-term score for students in a classroom.

Every data set corresponds to a particular student, for whom the x component denotes their midterm score and the y component denotes the quiz grade.

## 6. Elements of The Scatter Plots

Generally, scatterplots provide four key elements:



1. A continuous variable's frequencies are depicted on the X-axis. When any components may be characterized with an independent variable, this is considered the independent variable.
2. The numbers of the continuous variable are included on the Y-axis. These have generally become the dependent variable.
3. At the (X, Y) coordinate values of selected data, figures will be plotted. To express separate groups within the same graph, each graph would have the possibility of utilizing indicators of varying colors and patterns.
4. To determine how effectively a data model fits the data, we might decide to apply a fit line.


## 7. Conclusion

Scatterplots may be used to depict the way two continuous factors relate to one another. Therefore, ensure to execute the necessary hypothesis tests as well as determine statistical significance when you expect to use the sampling to analyze the aspects throughout an entire population.
