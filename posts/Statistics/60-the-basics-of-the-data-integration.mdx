# **The Basics of the Data Integration**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The applied and business method utilized for combining data through multiple sources to allow the user a combined, single concept of the data is referred to as data integration.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is Data Integration?
* Types of Data Integration Techniques.
* Data Integration Tools and Techniques.


## 3. What is Data Integration?

The approach of mixing data from multiple sources into a single dataset is referred to as data integration. Its principal purpose is to grant users uniform access and delivery of data through a broad range of concepts and structure types, as well as to justify the data needs of all applications and business procedures.

The statistics integration technique is one of the fundamental components in the standard facts management method, applied with expanding frequency as large statistics integration and the want to proportion existing facts keep growing.


### **Note:**

one of the important use cases for statistics integration offerings and answers is the management of commercial enterprise and client facts.


## 4. Types of Data Integration Techniques

_Extract, Transform and Load:_ Duplicates of datasets from different resources are collected collectively, combined, and loaded into a statistics warehouse or database.

_Extract, Load, and Transform:_ Data is fed into a big data system or statistics device in its current state and altered later for particular analytical uses.

_Change Data Capture: _Real-time database management that applies data alteration to a data warehouse or different repositories.

_Data Replication: _To keep statistics synced for operational causes and for backup, the data of a database is copied to different databases.

_Data Virtualization:_ at the region of uploading statistics into a new repository, statistics from many structures are simply included to generate a cohesive perspective.

_Streaming Data Integration:_ A real-time facts integration approach that always integrates and feeds several information streams into analytics programs and records repositories.


## 5. Why is Data Integration Important?

organizations that need to stay aggressive and modern-day are embracing big statistics with all of its benefits and problems. From company intelligence and client information analytics to facts enrichment and actual-time records shipping, data integration helps with queries in these huge datasets.

The management of business enterprise and customer records is one of the maximum essential use cases for records integration products and services. employer reporting, business intelligence (BI information integration), and superior organization analytics are supported with the aid of employer information integration, which feeds included records into information warehouses or digital information integration architecture.


## 6. Conclusion

Statistics integration equipment and systems are created through facts integration architects to make it simpler to integrate and direct records from source structures to goal systems through an automated statistics integration procedure.

This is all about data integration. Our following topic will be data transformation.
