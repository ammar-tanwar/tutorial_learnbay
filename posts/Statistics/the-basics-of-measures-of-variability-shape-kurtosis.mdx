**The Basics of Measures of Variability/Shape-Kurtosis**


## 1. The Tutorial's Summary


Descriptive studies comprise assessments of central tendency and variability measures (spread). The mean, median, and mode are central tendency measures, while standard deviation, variance, kurtosis, and skewness are examples of variability measures.




## 2. Scope of The Tutorial





●  What is kurtosis?


●  What are the types of kurtosis?


●  Calculation of the kurtosis in statistics?




## 3. What is kurtosis?




Let’s explore the kurtosis meaning in the easiest way.

The extent to which outliers are found in the distribution is known as kurtosis.



Whether the samples in a normal distribution possess heavy or light tails, kurtosis is a statistical measurement.

For a better understanding, let’s first understand the kurtosis meaning in finance.

Kurtosis is a measurement of financial risk that is used in finance. An increased possibility of obtaining extremely large and extremely few returns is represented by a significant kurtosis that would be attributed to a high degree of risk for an investment. A small kurtosis, in contrast, indicates a moderate amount of risk as the probability of extreme returns is comparatively lower.




### **Excessive kurtosis**



In probability and statistics, excess kurtosis is utilized to compare the kurtosis coefficient to the normal distribution of data. Leptokurtic distributions contain positive excess kurtosis, platykurtic distributions consist of negative excess kurtosis, and zero excess kurtosis, also known as Mesokurtic distribution. As kurtosis in normal distributions is 3 and excess kurtosis is measured by subtraction of kurtosis from 3.



**Excess kurtosis equals Kurt – 3**




## 4. Excess kurtosis Forms



### 
**1.**    **Heavy-Tailed Distribution (Leptokurtic, where kurtosis > 3)**

Leptokurtic has exceedingly long and thin tails, which raises the probability of outliers. Positive values of kurtosis represent a skewed allocation having broad tails. A distribution in which a majority of the numbers are distributed far from the mean and in the tails is described as having an extremely positive kurtosis.

**Figure 2: Leptokurtic**



**1.** **Platykurtic (kurtosis &lt; 3)**

Most of the data points are available and similar to the mean since this platykurtic distribution of data has a lower tail and stretched tails around the center. The platykurtic distribution is flatter and less peaked than the normal distribution.




### 
**1.**    **Mesokurtic (kurtosis = 3)**



Kurtosis is close to zero since the mesokurtic distribution is equivalent to the normal distribution. Distributions in Mesokurtic, therefore, have medium breadth, and curves have a medium peaked height.

## 5. Conclusion

Kurtosis is a statistic determining whether the data in a normal distribution contains heavy or light tails. Leptokurtic distributions contain positive excess kurtosis, platykurtic distributions possess negative excess kurtosis, and zero excess kurtosis (Mesokurtic distribution). The distribution of leptokurtic kurtosis is more than a normal distribution. The normal distribution, as well as the mesokurtics kurtosis, share an identical distribution. The distribution of platykurtic kurtosis has less than a normal distribution.

This is all about kurtosis. Our following topic will be the central limit theorem.
