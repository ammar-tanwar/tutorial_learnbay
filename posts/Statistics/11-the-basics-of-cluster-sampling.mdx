## 1. The Overview Of The Tutorial

 

Researchers use cluster sampling techniques to examine a sample containing a variety of sample parameters, like demographics, behavior, background, or any other population characteristic that could be the subject of the research being conducted.

 


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial

 



* Define cluster sampling.
* Types of cluster sampling.
* Steps that are used to perform cluster sampling.
* Example of cluster sampling.


## 3. Defining Cluster Sampling

 

A population is split up into multiple clusters that are descriptive of identical characteristics and have an equal chance of being part of the sample using the sampling method called cluster sampling.

## 4. How To Do Cluster Sampling?-Types of Cluster Sampling


●  	Single-Stage Cluster Sampling


●   Multi-Stage Cluster Sampling

 


### _Single-stage cluster sampling_:

Cluster sampling is the most accessible type of cluster sampling, consisting of 4 steps.

 

For example, we are curious about knowing the city's seventh-graders basic reading skills.

Maintaining a list of every seventh-grader and receiving information from a sample group dispersed throughout the city would be difficult. However, it is simple to generate a list of all schools and get data from a selected few of them. So we chose to adopt the cluster sampling technique.

 


## 5. Steps to perform Cluster Sampling

 


### 1. Defining the Population:

Similar to other sampling techniques, we must first characterize the population we plan to research.

_Example_: The population in our reading program study consists of each seventh-grader in the city.

 


### 2. Dividing the sample into clusters:


●  	The division will be based on the cluster’s characteristics.


●  	There is no duplication between clusters in terms of the same people or units. The same item does not appear in more than one cluster.


●  	Each cluster must be a miniature representative of the overall population.


     

_Example_: Through the school students attended, we grouped the seventh graders. We have to include all of the city's schools to represent the entire population. Since each student only attended one school, there is no duplication.

 


### 3. Randomly select the clusters to be used as our sample:

We can imitate simple random sampling by randomly picking and sampling from the clusters when any cluster acts as a miniature representation of the larger population. This assists in validating the observations.

 

_Example: _Every school is assigned a number, and a random sample is picked using a random number generator.

Depending on how big we want our sample size to be, we decide how many clusters to use. This calculation is then based on your best estimate of the standard deviation of the seventh-grader's reading levels, our selected confidence interval and confidence level, and the estimated size of the total population of seventh-graders.

The required sample size would then be estimated by using a sample size technique.

 


### 4. Collecting data from the sample:

After the above step, we proceed with our analysis and collect data from each unit in the selected clusters.

 

_Example:_ All seventh-graders in the schools that comprised our sample were given reading competency tests.

 


### Multi-stage cluster sampling:

Rather than collecting data from all the units in the selected clusters, multi-stage cluster sampling includes selecting a subset from those units to define the sample.

Double-stage sampling is the method of collecting data from each of the independent units.

 

Example: We reduce our sample in two more steps instead of collecting data from every seventh-grader within selected schools:


●  	We get a random sample of seventh-grade students from each school.


●  	We pick a sample of students at random from those classes.

The chosen participants are significantly smaller, making it easier to gather data.

 


## 6. Conclusion

 

In this tutorial, we learned about cluster sampling and the ways to perform it by providing an example. Our next tutorial will be on convenience sampling.
