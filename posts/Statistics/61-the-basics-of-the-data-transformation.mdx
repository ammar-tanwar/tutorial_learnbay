# **The Basics of The Data Transformation**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

When an organization has to research data from various business operations, including customer support to supply chain management, it requires data transformation throughout the board. It is also required at a time when the company wants information to enable an increasing number of automated and intelligent technologies.


## 2. The Scope of The Tutorial



* Data Transformation-Explained
* What comprises a data transformation's essential steps?
* Some Benefits of Data Transformation


## 3. Data Transformation-Explained

The role of data transformation comes into play when companies must obtain data from multiple sources, merge it, and maintain the quality of the merged data in order to generate appropriate insights and assure the accurate performance of automated systems.

Data transformation also plays a vital role when it refers to managing data obtained from one system as acceptable with data over other sources and that the combined data is gradually compatible for application in the systems that require it, data transformation steps up to the plate.

Transformations mainly include transforming raw sources of data into types that have been cleaned, validated, and are acceptable for specific uses. Data integration, data migration, data warehousing, and data preparation are all elements in the data management process that require data transformation.

**Note:**

An alternative name for the data transformation process is "extract/transform/load" (ETL).


## 4. What comprises a data transformation's essential steps?

The steps that are followed for data transformation are:

_Data Discovery: _Data profiling tools are used in this step to identify the structure and features of the data and to evaluate how it will be transformed.

_Data Mapping: _Researchers in the field of data connect or match data fields from one source to a different one in this step.

_Code Generation: _This part of the process involves developing the software code that is necessary to transform the data.

_Execution of The Code: _This step includes the transformation of the data.

_Review: _The data analysts or the company users confirm that the data output adheres to the specified transformation criteria at this stage and, if not, identify and correct any inconsistencies and defects.


## 5. Some Benefits of Data Transformation

Data transformation is fundamental to a business data program because of offering additional features that are as follows:



* Improved data quality
* Reductions in defects, including missing values
* Less components are required for changing the data
* Advanced monitoring and data presentation
* Additional useful data, specifically for complex organizational analytics/intelligence.


## 6. Conclusion

The individuals responsible for data transformation throughout an organization are typically data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists. Before data is transferred into the required databases for collection and utilization, they analyze the source data, determine the essential data formats, perform data mapping, and perform the overall transformation process.

This is all about data transformation. Our following topic will be finding and dealing with missing values.
