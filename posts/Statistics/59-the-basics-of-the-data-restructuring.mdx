# **The Basics of The Data Restructuring**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

Statistics has generated numerous practical data analytics solutions for organizational data restructuring and alternating. It operates advanced data modeling tools and runs informational platforms supporting several business requirements.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Why do we need to restructure the data?
* The Three different types of restructuring data.
* What structure should the data be organized in the new file?


## 3. Why do we need to restructure the data?

To restructure data through many variables or columns in a single case or row to groups of associated cases or rows, and vice versa, we have to utilize the Restructure data approach. The procedure also provides a solution for data transposition. The rebuilt data comprise multiple response datasets from the initial datasets.


**Note:**

 Appointing the restructured form is the initial step.


## 4. The Three different types of restructuring data



1. ** Wide to long**

When we need to alter a number of variables into groups of similar rows for all cases, prefer this option if each of the variables of a specific case is shown in a single row i.e, either a wide format or a long format.



2. ** Long to wide**

When a long-format significant dataset possesses many rows for all distinct cases, prefer this option for merging connected variables into a single row for all instances that are having wide format.



3. ** Transpose all data**

If we need to transform each row or case into all columns or variables and each column into all rows then we prefer this option. In the latest data, all rows are converted into columns, and all columns are converted into rows. The Matrix transpose feature's functionality is copied by this option.


## 5. What structure should the data be organized in the new file?

The structure format in the file depends on which kind of grouping we want.

These groupings can be classified as below. 


### **Procedures that require groups of cases**

When we need to perform analyses that require a grouping variable then our data should be arranged into case groups. For instance, involve the usage of independent samples with t-tests or nonparametric tests, common linear representation, mixed representation, OLAP cubes, and univariate, multivariate, and variance elements. Select _Wide to long_ when the existing data structure is composed of variable groups and we want to perform these analyses.


### **Procedures that require groups of variables**

When we want to assess reiterative evaluation, then our data should be arranged into groups of variables. Instances comprehend time-dependent covariate analysis that has Cox regression analysis having paired samples with the t-test, connected samples with nonparametric testing, and reiterative measures with the common linear model.

when we need to perform these analyses and our existing data form is case groups then select_ Long to broad_.


## 6. Conclusion

Data restructuring presents an additional adaptable approach to interact with the data and an extra dynamic method to combine data from varied platforms, permitting us to quickly quantify opportunities and adapt significant action.

This is all about data restructuring. Our following topic will be data integration.
