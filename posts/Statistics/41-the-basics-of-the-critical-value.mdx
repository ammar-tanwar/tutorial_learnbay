# **The Basics of The Critical Value**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

While examining the validity, efficiency, and region where error or differences within any sample set might emerge, the critical value is significant. The margin of error is determined by applying for a number as a key component. According to the critical value, the features of the sample size you're analyzing could be indicated through its value.

* How do we calculate critical Value?
* An example of critical value.


## 3. What is The Critical Value?

Critical values are among the two techniques in hypothesis testing that allow us to conclude whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. Determining the p-value is an alternate technique.

The margin of error inside a data set is measured utilizing the statistician's critical value, which is stated as follows:

Critical probability (p*) = 1 - (Alpha / 2)

where Alpha = 1 - (the confidence level / 100).

Different ways exist to describe the critical value: as a critical t statistic which is equal to the critical probability and as a critical Z-score which is connected to cumulative probability. The critical value additionally describes a number of elements of the margin of error that researchers can use to measure the accuracy of the data they analyze.

**Note:**

Our critical value will be identical for both contexts even if we are constructing a 95% confidence interval and applying a p = 0.05 degree of statistical significance.


## 4. How do we calculate the critical value?

It might not be difficult to determine the critical value of a data set. In addition, depending on the size of our sample, we can represent the critical value in any of two ways. An explanation of how this can be accomplished is demonstrated in the steps below:


### **1. Computing the alpha value:**

While using the formula alpha value (a) = 1 - (the confidence level / 100), compute the alpha value prior to calculating the critical probability.

Alpha value = 1 - (95/100) = 1 - (0.95) = 0.05.

The alpha value throughout this instance is 0.05.


### **2. Calculating the critical probability:**

Estimate the critical probability by using the first formula's alpha value.

Critical probability (p*) = 1 - (0.05 / 2) = 1 - (0.025) = 0.975.

In this example, the critical probability is 0.975, or 97.5%.


### **3. Using the critical t statistic for smaller sample sizes:**

The critical t statistic is the correct description for the critical probability when we are testing a small number of samples. The t statistic can be applied to show the critical probability level of 97.5% as follows:

Degree of freedom (df) = the sample size - 1. 

Deduct one from this frequency to acquire the degree of freedom if our sample size is 25, for reference. It could be 24 in this situation.


### **4. Expressing the critical value as a Z-score for a larger set of data:**

It is possible to refer to the critical value as a Z-score for sample sizes greater than forty samples in a data set. The cumulative probability of the Z-score must be the same as the critical probability. The likelihood that a random variable will be smaller than or exactly equivalent to a given value is referenced as the cumulative probability. The critical probability, sometimes defined as the critical value, shall match this probability.


## 5. An example of critical value.

The critical value or critical probability for a sample data set are being determined by using the p-value or the critical probability approach as indicated by the given example:

Consider comparing the probability that a test statistic will be higher or lower than on alpha value, or significance level, of our sample data set. The p-value, commonly referred to as the critical probability, can be applied to identify the critical value. As an outcome, the chance of getting a sample data set which is as significant as the initial test statistic would be expressed through the p-value.

We can reject a null hypothesis through any significance level that is greater than or equal to 0.01 when our hypothesis test's p-value, for say, is equal to 0.01. We will not reject the null hypothesis when our significance level was lower or equal to 0.01. In this example, the p-value of 0.01 will have to be equivalent to the critical value. Therefore, without directly mentioning our significance level, this range will be significant for determining the reliability and strength of the evidence for rejecting a null hypothesis.


## 6. Conclusion

In order to accurately evaluate small numbers of samples or data sets when the standard deviation is undetermined, the critical value should always be represented as a t statistic.

This is all about the critical value. Our following topic will be binomial distribution.
