## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

 

Due to the reduced participant volume when using judgment sampling, researchers might conduct focus groups in addition to interviews and other more interactive forms of data gathering.

This generally takes significantly less time than obtaining data from huge volume segments.

 


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



●  	What is judgment sampling?


●  	When is it used?


●  	How do we perform judgment sampling?

 


## 3. What Is the Definition of Judgement Sampling?


Judgmental sampling chooses the sample members by relying on the researcher's competence and judgment.

There is a possibility that the results will be highly accurate with a limited margin of error as this researcher's knowledge is required to construct a sample in this sampling technique.

 

When applying judgemental sampling to selecting a sample, the researchers pick and choose each person who will be a participant in the sample. In this sampling process, the researcher's understanding is important, so the sample's participants are not picked at random.

 


## 4. How might judgemental sampling easily be applied?


Since only a significant percentage of a group contains the characteristics that a researcher wants from the sample group, judgmental sampling is most beneficial.

 

When researchers found that other sampling procedures would take much longer and they were convinced in their skills in selecting a sample for research, they chose to apply judgemental sampling.

 


## 5. Points to consider while selecting a population for judgemental sampling.


The population and areas of interest should be specifically described to enable efficient, targeted, and risk-based sampling. The particular characteristics or divisions of a population that examiners sample are referred to as the areas of focus.

The sample sizes are not determined mathematically since judgemental sampling does not result in an estimate of the population. Investigators evaluate the population, areas of focus, types of items sampled, and sample size with their professional judgment, skills, and knowledge.

Examiners pick on areas of focus and the size of a judgment sample at the same time, commonly taking into account the scope and objectives of the regulatory activity as well as the features of the population. The changes in the population and growing areas are the factors that need to be considered in the judgemental sampling.

 


## 6. Example of Judgemental Sampling


To assist us in understanding judgment sampling, think about the following frequently used example.

Since reading books is one of the main reasons individuals wear eyeglasses, this is the information that a group of researchers wants to know.

So, according to common sense, the research team's focus should be entirely focused on those who do use eyeglasses.

Judgment sampling is applied in this technique.

The probability that researchers might learn whether or not people wear eyeglasses to read books improves if they use their professional judgment to pick a sample that only includes people who wear glasses.



## 7. Conclusion


Since you've understood the basics of judgment sampling, you should recognize when to apply it and what features and drawbacks come with doing so. Our following tutorial will be on variables and their types.
