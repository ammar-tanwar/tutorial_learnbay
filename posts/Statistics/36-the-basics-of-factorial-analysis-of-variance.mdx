# **The Basics of Factorial Analysis of Variance**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn factorial analysis in detail and how it is effective in manipulating data. The two-way ANOVA, The factorial ANOVA f-test, or the factorial analysis of variance are the other names given to factorial ANOVA.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is factorial ANOVA?
* Example of factorial ANOVA.
* Why do we use factorial ANOVA?


## 3. What is factorial ANOVA?

Factorial Way analysis of variance might sometimes be applied to investigate studies to take into consideration the overall impact of several factors at once, or "factorial experiments."

 


## 4. Example of factorial ANOVA

Varying levels of the factors are used in repeated tests. A 2 x 2 factorial design implements all of the two factors in two different levels.

Let's choose an example to show this. Let's suppose a brand-new pharmaceutical has been produced to regulate high blood pressure.

We would really like to determine how much drugs would be used together with the influence of gender. Essentially, the first factor is the dosage of the drug, and the second is gender (or vice versa).

Let's say that we carefully consider two doses of the medicines, including 100 mg and 250 mg (1 / 2). These two proportions describe the first factor's two levels.

The other factor's two phases are therefore male and female (A / B).

As a result, the following are the main two factors, every one of which is used twice. In other terms, our factorial design is 2 x 2.

Consequently, there must be four distinct treatment groups, corresponding to each combination of levels of factors involved. The groups are referred to by the labels A1, A2, and B1, B2, per the standard. Such associations suggest the following.

A1: Male patients were treated with 100 mg of said medicine.

A2: Male patients were treated with 250 mg of said medicine.

B1: Female patients take 100 mg of said medicine.

B2: Female patients take 250 mg of said medicine.

Gender as well as the dosage of the medicine are the major factors in this circumstance, whereas the variable of interest is the reduction in hypertension after a month.


## 5. Example’s Main Effects and Interaction

An output that can regularly fluctuate across levels of a factor is considered to have a significant impact.

In our situation, amount and gender are the main two factors.

We might even evaluate how they enhance the effects through a factorial ANOVA. Since distinctions in one factor rely on the amount with another factor, this is considered by the term interaction effect.

It's necessary to keep in mind that interaction takes place among factors instead of levels. Once we can discuss the consequences of one factor with mentioning the other, we understand that there's no connection between the factors.


## 6. Example based on hypothesis testing

Three hypotheses are required to be evaluated in the example above. And those are:

H01: The main effect of ‘quantity’ is not significant. 

H02: The main effect of ‘gender’ is not significant. 

H03: Interaction effect is not present.

The null hypothesis for its primary gender effect suggests that there isn't a significant variance in the lowering of hypertension comparing males and females.

When any patients receive either 100 mg or 250 mg of the medication, there is absolutely no meaningful difference in the overall effect size in regards to the decrease of hypertension.  

The null hypothesis for the significant relationship shows that the two main effects, gender, and quantity, are not related. With each hypothesis, its F-statistic is determined as an element of the mathematical technique.


## 7. Why do we use factorial ANOVA?

While being interested in examining treatment variability, factorial approaches are the better option.

Factorial designs perform effectively. We properly blend these research into one instead of conducting a variety of separate ones.

The only appropriate approach for researching interrelations is using factorial designs.


## 8. Conclusion

Factorial analysis of variance is an appropriate approach for researching interrelations using factorial designs.

This is all about factorial ANOVA. Our following topic will be correlation coefficients.
