# **The Basics of the P-Value Method**


## 1. The Overview of the Tutorial

In real life, the p-value should be very low for rejecting the null hypothesis, thus the significance level is usually mentioned before. A researcher may possibly be unable to compare the outcomes of two distinct tests because different researchers apply different levels of significance when analyzing a question. This issue can be resolved with P-values.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is the p-value?
* Define null hypothesis.
* Understanding p-value.
* How do we calculate the p-value?
* Statistical significance using P-values.
* Writing p-values


## 3. What Is P-Value?

A p-value is a number determined from a statistical test and represents how likely we would get a specific set of observations if the null hypothesis is correct.

In hypothesis testing, P-values are calculated to evaluate whether one should accept or reject the null hypothesis. The possibility of accepting the null hypothesis improves with the decreased p-value.


## 4. Define null hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is included in all statistical tests. The null hypothesis for the most of tests is that there isn't a correlation between our interest variables or that there isn't any difference among the groups.

For instance, the null hypothesis in a two-tailed t-test assumes that there is no distinction between the groups.

Example: 

We are seeking to find out if the longevity of two types of mice maintained on different diets, diet A and diet B, differ. The two-tailed t-test can be applied statistically for comparing these two diets.


## 5. Understanding p-value

We can evaluate how likely it is for our data to have occurred under the null hypothesis by checking at the p-value, or probability value. This is conducted by figuring out the likelihood of our test statistic, which refers to the figure derived from a statistical analysis of your data.

The p-value reflects how commonly we would estimate noticing test statistic which is equally extreme or even more extreme compared to the one generated by our statistical test when the test's null hypothesis is true. As the test statistic calculated from our data differs significantly further from the distribution of test statistics expected by the null hypothesis, the p-value lowers.

The p-value is a proportion; for example, a 0.05 p-value signifies that, when the null hypothesis is true, we must find a test statistic that was approximately as significant as the one we received 5% of the time.

Figure 1: P-Value

Example:

The test statistic in our t-test must accurately reflect the test statistic out from the null hypothesis (that there is no difference among the groups) if the mice lived similarly long on either diet, and the resulting p-value would be near 1. Because the groups in real life are certainly not completely identical, the number won't approach 1.

The p-value will reduce and our test statistic might differ significantly from the values specified by the null hypothesis, however, if there exists an average difference in longevity between the two groups. The p-value will never be 0 as it is always attainable, although highly improbable, that the patterns in our data are the result of coincidence.


## 6. How do we calculate the p-value?

The statistical test we use to examine the hypothesis will decide how to compute the p-value.

Multiple statistical tests generate various test statistics while using different assumptions. The statistical test which best fits our data and the result or relationship we would like to evaluate should be our decision.

The size of the test statistic required to obtain a certain p-value that varies according to the number of independent variables which we test.

Example:

A two-sample t-test is a useful approach to compare the groups when we are simply examining two distinct diets. Utilizing various pairwise comparisons will end up producing falsely low p-values and allow us to overstate the significance of the group differences. Rather, use an ANOVA for comparing three different diets.


**Note:**

Topic ANOVA will be covered in our next tutorial.


## 7. Statistical significance using P-values

P-values often are usually applied by researchers to identify the statistical significance of a specific trend we have observed.

A statistical test's p-value should be modest enough to reject the null hypothesis for the test to be considered significant statistically.

How small is too small? A most frequent cutoff is p 0.05, which means that we must only assume getting a test statistic as extreme as the one obtained by our test 5% of said time. Although the cutoff completely depends on our field of research; several fields support cutoffs of 0.01, and even 0.001.

The alpha value is another name for the defined threshold that is used to assess statistical significance.

Example:

Since the two mouse diets we compared generated p-values that were below 0.01, under our alpha threshold of 0.05, we arrived at the conclusion that there were statistically significant differences among them.


## 8. Writing p-values

P-values for statistical tests are usually found in the findings section of a research report in addition to the important details readers need to recognize the importance of the results, like the correlation coefficient in linear regression or even the standard deviation of the difference among the treated group in a t-test.

Example:

After we studied the life expectancies of mice fed diets A and B, we determined that diet A's longevity was generally lower (mean = 2.1 years; sd = 0.12) from diet B's longevity (mean = 2.6 years; sd = 0.1), having a difference in average of 6 months (t(80) = -12.75; p 0.01).


## 9. Conclusion

P-values are commonly considered as the possibility that our test will reject the null hypothesis despite it being true.

This is all about the p-value. Our following topic will be the chi-square test.
