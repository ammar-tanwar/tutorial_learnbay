## 1. Overview

 

By studying samples, anybody can conclude populations. Since samples are useful, affordable, practical, and manageable, it is easy to gather data from them. The sample is more compact and easy to analyze than the population. Conclusions made from samples are expected to be applied to the entire population and often even to the future.

 


## 2. Scope of This Tutorial

 

In this tutorial, we will learn:


●  	Sample size - Definition


●  	Selection of the correct sample size.


●  	Calculation of the sample size.

 


## 3. Definition of Sample Size


Despite our interest in all of the contributors in a big sample size survey, it's not really realistic to acquire feedback or results from each and every single one of them. Therefore we select a sample that is random & small in size population, which also represents the entire population as a whole.


Let's take an example. We want to test a new product on a sample size that is frequent of the target population to forecast how the audience in the same age group will respond to it. The number of people in that age group who will be surveyed will influence the sample size in this case.



## 4. Points we need to consider before the calculation of a sample size.

 


### **1.**    **Population characteristics:**


How many people in total are we speaking to? We should be sure about who matches in our group and who doesn't.


Example: If we want to find out who owns dogs, we must include those who have ever owned a dog.



### **2.**    **The margin of error or confidence interval:**


It is for sure that we will get the error. Now at this point, we need to decide how much error we will allow. The representation of the mean is the margin of error. We need to set how much distribution there should be in the population's mean and the sample's mean value.



### **3.**    **Confidence level:**


It addresses our confidence level that the actual mean should fit within our margin of error. 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals represent the most frequently used estimates of confidence.





### **4.**    **Standard Deviation:**


We need to assess how much the answers will differ from each other and from the mean number in this stage. A high standard deviation indicates that the values are distributed over a much wider spread with absolutely small and absolutely large outlying figures. A low standard deviation indicates that each of the values will be centered around the mean number.

### **5.**    **Finding Z-Score:**


Z-score, also referred to as a standard score, shows you how far a data point differs from the mean. The next step involves converting the level of confidence into a Z-score. The most frequent confidence levels are mentioned below with their z-score.:


90% – Z Score = 1.645


95% – Z Score = 1.96


99% – Z Score = 2.576





## 5. Calculating Sample size


The formula for calculation is:

 

Necessary sample size =

 

A margin of error is a statistical measurement that reflects the difference between both actual and expected data.

 

This equation provides either a very big or unknowable population size.

 

Example:

Suppose we selected a confidence level of 95%, 5 standard deviations, having a +/- 5% confidence interval for its margin of error (0.05).

((1.96)2 x .5(.5)) / (.05)2

(3.8416 x .25) / .0025

.9604 / .0025

384.16

Three hundred eighty-five participants are needed.


## 6. Conclusion


In this tutorial, we learned what sample size is and what points we need to consider for finding our sample size. The sample size should be calculated before the beginning of the process of any experiment that involves statistical inference.
