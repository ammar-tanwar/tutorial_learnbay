# **The Basics of The Chi-Square Test**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

In this article, we will come to know about chi-square in statistics, and also we will discuss what is it and how is that used. Chi-square is most commonly used by researchers who survey because it is applied to categorical data. These categorical values are then compared to check the relationship for this categorical data for checking their independence.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is chi-square in statistics?
* When do we use chi-square?  
* The formula for Chi-Square.
* Example for chi-square.


## 3. What is chi-square in statistics?

We use the chi-square in statistics to compare the observed and expected results. The difference that we get from comparing is then sought out by checking whether it is due to chance or due to having a relationship between the variable. We use random, raw, mutually exclusive data for the chi-square for example the tossing of a coin. 

 

In hypothesis testing, we quite often use the chi-square, as it compares the size of any inconsistency among the expected and actual results depending on the size of the sample and the number of variables in the relationship. We utilize the degree of freedom in chi-square for checking if the null hypothesis can be rejected depending on the total number of variables and samples that we use in the experiment. 

 

We also use it to test how best it is to fit between an observed distribution and conceptual distribution in the frequency.

## 4. When do we use chi-square?  

When we have data to be analyzed by random sample then the chi-square is the appropriate selection and also when the variable that we have is categorical. For checking whether the result that we received is in line with the expected result or not. Categorical data are an example of the data that is collected through survey responses.

 

Example of this research is demography, consumer and marketing research for political and social sciences, and also the economy.

 

We also have something called a nominal variable which is a categorical variable differing from the quality and having a numerical order that is irrelevant. For example, asking about the favorite color would give us a nominal variable. Whereas asking the age of someone will give us an ordinal set of data. 


## 5. The formula for Chi-Square

x2=(o-E)2/E

In the given formula,

The chi-square is the x2

O = Observed value

E = Expected value

is the Summation


## 6. Example for chi-square

Let us take an example of tossing the coin where before tossing we expect the result to have exactly a 50/50 chance of getting a head or tails another example is a real coin tossed times. 

 

An equal probability of landing on either side will be possible when the coin is fair. The Head will come up 50 times and the tail will come up 50 times when expecting to toss a fair coin 100 times.

           

We might get 50/50, 60/40, or even 90/10. In this scenario 


is depicted as the results of 100 coins tossed in comparison to the theoretical model where we imagined the coin would give 50/50 results.


## 7. Conclusion

Consequently, chi-square can be used to analyze whether or not an actual distribution reflects a theoretical distribution of frequencies.

This is all about the chi-square. Our following topic will be regression.
