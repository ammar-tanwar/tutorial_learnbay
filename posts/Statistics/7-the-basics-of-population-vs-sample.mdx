## 1. Overview

 

The concepts of sample and population are related, despite the common differences that they have between each other. Most of the time, learners get confused about population vs. sample, but it's not that hard to differentiate between them. A sample is taken from the population. Therefore, without a population sample, a survey would not exist, but vice-versa is not true. A population provides the sample we use to make inferences about the entire population.

 


## 2. The Scope of This Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn


●  	What is meant by "population?"


●  	Sampling definition.


●  	Population and sample correlation.


●  	The contrast between sampling and the population.

 


## 3. What is "population" in statistics?

 

The "population" is the total number of objects under examination that hold one or more common characteristics, like 'all of India's inhabitants' and 'all of the inhabitants of India.' The term "population" does not just refer to people; it can also refer to things like objects, events, structures, etc.

 


## 4. What is the definition of a sample?

 

A "sample" comprises the participants who had been taken from the population for examination; sample size refers to the total number of units in a sample, whereas sampling units refer to the units being analyzed.

 


## 5. What is the correlation between population and sample?

 

The first idea that appears in our minds once we hear the term "population" is a massive group of individuals. In the same approach, a population in statistics refers to a big group of people that share at least one feature. The word is commonly used in comparison to the sample, which is simply a portion of the entire population selected to represent the whole group.

Figure 1: Population and Sample


         

The population is referred to as all people, groups, things, and everything else that can be created and has specific characteristics. The sample, on the other hand, is a partial subset of the population that is collected through a systematic procedure to learn about the features of the parent set. The variations between the population and the sample are covered in the tutorial.

 


## 6. Differences Between Population and Sample.

1. The population is the entire group of all objects with shared features that make up the universe. A sample is a subset of the available population that has been selected to participate in the research study.

2. Every single member of the entire community is represented in the population. In contrast, a sample just comprises a small percentage of the population.

3. Although the measure of a sample observed is known as a statistic, the feature of the population based on all units has termed a parameter.

4. A census, or entire enumeration, is the method of gathering data from each unit of the population. On the contrary, a survey method is carried out to collect data from a sample, which uses a sampling procedure.

5. In a population, the priority is on determining the elements' characteristics, while in a sample, the priority is on developing generalizations about the features of the population that the sample was selected from.

So, this is all about the basic concepts of population and sample.


## 7. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned what is meant by "population" and what its types are; we also came to know what is meant by "sampling" and their relationship and difference between each other. I hope you are now able to differentiate population vs. sample. In the next chapter, we will shed light on the sample size.
