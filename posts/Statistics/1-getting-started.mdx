## Introduction to Statistics for Data Science

## 1. Overview

Initially, statisticians, economists, and business owners implemented statistics for calculating and representing appropriate data for their businesses. However, in recent days statistics have been used in fields like weather prediction, economic estimation, etc, and at present statistics is being used significantly in domains like data science, machine learning, business intelligence, data analysis, and computer science, among numerous others.

 

This tutorial explains what statistics is and how it works with data science.


## 2. How are statistics used in data science?


Data science and machine learning essentially focus on statistics that are required for solving real-world problems. So, it is important to learn the mathematical equations, theories, and statistical formulas for a data scientist to know the appropriate application of the same based on the scenario.


## 3. What is the simple definition of statistics? 

A field of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of a stack of arithmetical data and the collection of quantitative data are statistics. 

In statistics, we need to take raw data to analyze it and build data models based on that data to infer the outcome of the prediction.

 


## 4. What are the different types of statistics? 

**Descriptive statistics:** In statistics, descriptive coefficients summarize a given data set, which sometimes represents the entire population and sometimes represents the sample of a population. This is known as descriptive statistics.

 

**Inferential statistics: **A field of statistics that uses analytical tools for illustrating conclusions about a population by examining random samples is called Inferential statistics.

The important role played by data scientists in programming, researching, and executing businesses is done by implementing statistics. In data science, learning statistics is as important as learning a programming language. Expertise in statistics leads the most talented researchers by interpreting data, recommending innovative solutions, and creating ways to achieve improvements.

**Explanation of Some Statistical Terminology**


## In statistical programs, we have certain terminologies with which we need to be familiar. These statistical terms are:

 

**_Population:_** The source from which we collect the raw data.

 

**_Sample:_** A portion of data or population used for sampling data.

 

**_Variable: _**Any countable or measurable data.

 

**_Quantitative analysis:_** Collection of data and interpretation of that data by using patterns and by data visualization.

 

**_Probability distribution:_** A mathematical idea to get the probabilities for possible outcomes.

 

**_Descriptive statistics:_** Nature of a population.

 

**_Inferential statistics:_** Predictions on a given population.


**_Range: _**The difference of value in a data set

 

**_Variance:_** The difference between the variable and the expected value.

 

**_Standard deviation:_** The mean distribution of the dataset. 

 


## 5. How is Statistics used for building an influential model?


The team that works on data needs statistics for answering questions that appear to perform their tasks better, as these questions will have statistical significance on the data that we use for our model building.

Statistics answer important questions about data that we need to consider while building a model that is as follows:

 


●  	In the data point for developing the model, which features are important are acknowledged by statistics that reduce Overfitting. It also helps in improving accuracy and reduces training time.

 


●  	The way of conducting experiments is served by statistics which helps us perfect the number of variables and data artifacts to track and manage.

 


●  	The strategy that can be designed considering the outcomes of the experiment is decided by a statistical method that retains the success and the first phase of any sound data analytics project.  

 


●  	The performance metrics that we should use are approached by statistics that figure out the data representation of an organization's actions, abilities, and overall quality.

 

The most crucial part of statistics in data science is that it decides the type of problem we are dealing with and helps in deciding the structure and type of inputs, outputs, and metrics by the objective.

 


## 6. Conclusion


The emerging need for the collection of data and for organizing and analyzing those data is fulfilled by the use of statistics. We can also use statistics for analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing those data. By giving valuable insight and by solving complex problems, statistics reduce future risks in economic, scientific, and social fields.
