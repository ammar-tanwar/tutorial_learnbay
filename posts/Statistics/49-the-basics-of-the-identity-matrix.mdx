# **The Basics of The Identity Matrix**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

The other way of describing it is that an identity matrix is a specific kind of diagonal matrix, in which the main diagonal entries are ones and the remaining ones are zeros. Let's explore its explanation, aspects, and application by using some examples.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is The Identity Matrix?
* Understanding Identity Matrix
* Aspects of Identity Matrix.


## 3. What is The Identity Matrix?

The identity matrix is comprised of an n x n square matrix having zeros with all other components and ones for the diagonal. It may also be defined as an elementary matrix or a unit matrix. It is indicated as In or generally with I, into which n signifies the square matrix's size. For instance,

## 4. Understanding Identity Matrix

A square matrix is considered an identity matrix where all of the main diagonal members are one while all other components are zero. It will be denoted by the character "In" or only "I." Any matrix would generate a matrix therefore as a result of it being multiplied by the identity matrix. The contents of the specified matrix are the same. Expressed in different terms, a square matrix is considered to be an identity matrix when each of its primary diagonals is 1s and the rest are all 0s. The identity matrix for all 2 x 2 as well as 3 x 3 is shown below:

Figure 2: 3x3 Identity Matrix

The identity matrix for order 3 or unit matrix for order 3 x 3 is the item that is referenced over here.

, in which n x n represents the matrix's ordering, gives the Identity Matrix.

A denotes any square matrix having type n x n will have the formula            A x 

 = A.

**Note:**

When an identity matrix is introduced with no indication of the execution, this is reasonable to assume that it represents an identity matrix with respect to multiplication.


## 5. Aspects of Identity Matrix


### **1) The matrix will always be square when**

Since these matrices generally feature the same total number of rows and columns, these are regarded as square matrices. There exists a corresponding Identity matrix, n x n, for each whole number n.


### **2) The matrix may be derived by multiplying a matrix through the unit matrix.**

While operating on matrix multiplication, determining the size of the matrix is significant since this multiplication is rarely clearly defined.

Similarly, we obtain with the "m x n" matrix C

C = C = C

The dimensions of the matrix are significant as multiplication through the unit is comparable to multiplying a number with 1. For instance:

C=

Assume that this includes 2 rows as well as 4 columns, then the matrix above would be 2 x 4.

Now let us multiply the identity matrix of two by two by C.

Therefore it was proved.


### **3) The consequence of multiplying two inverse matrices always results in an identity.**

An identity matrix is constructed through multiplying two matrices which are carbon copies of each other.

## 6. Conclusion

This is all about the identity matrix. Our following topic will be the addition of matrices.
