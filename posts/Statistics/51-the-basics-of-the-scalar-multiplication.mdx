# **The Basics of the Scalar Multiplication**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

A matrix refers to a rectangular series of numbers, however, a scalar is a real number. Let us understand in this tutorial the matrix scalar multiplication, its aspects, and its instances.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* Introduction to Matrix Scalar Multiplication
* What is Scalar Multiplication?
* Aspects of Scalar Multiplication in Matrix.


## 3. Introduction to Matrix Scalar Multiplication

The matrix is multiplied by a scalar during executing matrix scalar multiplication. It is reasonably possible to multiply a real number by a matrix or vice versa in precisely the same method of how two or more real numbers or matrices can be multiplied.

Following are the two main types of multiplications that we find while dealing with matrices:



* "Matrix multiplication" would be the method of multiplying one matrix with another matrix.
* The concept of "matrix scalar multiplication" applies to multiplying a matrix from a scalar or a number.


**Note:**

Matrix multiplication commonly belongs to one of two types: _vector-matrix multiplication,_ that which multiplies the entire matrix from another value, as well as _scalar matrix multiplication,_ which multiplies a single real number with every other component of the matrix.


## 4. What is Scalar Multiplication?

Real numbers are referenced as the scalars within matrices. The effect of the multiplication of a real number from a matrix is defined as scalar multiplication. Thus every entry within the matrix is multiplied by its given scalar in scalar multiplication. 

Example:

Let us find 2A for the above matrix,

## 5. Aspects of Scalar Multiplication in Matrix

When k, a, and b are scalars and A & B are matrices that have the same order, therefore:



* The order of A and kA is the same.

For instance, any scalar multiple of A, just like 2A, will be of order 2 x 3 when A comprises a matrix of order 2 x 3.

* Commutative matrix scalar multiplication is performed. Which are, k A = A k.
* Matrix scalar multiplication is distributive. â€“ i.e., (ab) A = a (bA).
* The matrix scalar multiplication would be influenced by the distributive characteristic as described in the following:

* A scalar multiplied by zero matrix results in the zero matrices itself. 
* The addition reverse of A, -A, is obtained by -1 and A being multiplied together.


## 6. Conclusion

All diagonal matrices constitute scalar matrices, while not all scalar matrices are diagonal matrices. This is so because a scalar matrix generally comprises the same elements, a diagonal matrix might consist of various elements.

This is all about scalar multiplication. Our following topic will be matrix transpose.
