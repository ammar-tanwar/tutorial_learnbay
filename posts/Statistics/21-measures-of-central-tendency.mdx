## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial




The measures of central tendency function as a realistic description of all the gathered information. It is usually described as the numerical result that perfectly reflects the data. A central tendency explains what determines the "average" or "normal" for a dataset. Additionally, the data set is compacted by central tendency.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial




  * Measures of central tendency: What's that?


  * What are the ways to implement the measures of central tendency?


## 3. What are the measures of central tendency?



A central tendency measure, frequently referred to by the terms "measure of center" or "central location," is a form of precise measure. It seeks to distinguish the completion of a data set with a single value corresponding to a measure of the central location. It seeks to characterize the whole data set with a single number that belongs to the middle or center of its distribution.


The set of data's center point or standard value is depicted by the measures of central tendency, which offer a statistical measure. These measurements show where the majority of values in a distribution fall, as well as the distribution's center.


The three essential measured values of central tendency have been the mode, the median, and the mean. The average or center value in the range is presented separately by all of these measures.

**_The mean, median, or mode measures the most frequent pattern of the selected data set._**


## 4. Define the mean and the way to calculate it.



### **Mean:**


The mean is often the average value of said numbers that are summed together. A mean is a number that represents the center of the data, denoted by Âµ for the population mean.

Example: Consider the following sequence of numbers: 10, 10, 20, 40, and 70.

The mean (sometimes known as the "average") is calculated by multiplying all of the numbers by the number of elements in the set: 10 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 70 / 5 = 30.

Therefore Mean = 30


## 5. What is 'median,' and how do we perform it?



### **Median:**


The median is the value that divides the data into two equal sections, i.e., the number of terms on the right side equals the number of terms on the left side. It should only be used after the data has been organized in ascending or descending order.

For example, arranging the group from lowest to highest and finding the precise midpoint yields the median. The midpoint value is referred to as its median. Consider the following group of data

10 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 70

The median is 20 in the given data set.

## 6. Define the mode and the way to calculate it.




### **Mode:**

A figure that comes most commonly in the collection of data would be the mode.

Example:

{8, 2, 7, 1, 2, and 2}

The mode for the provided data set is 2.

In the presented data set, the number 2 appeared thrice, more times than any other number.



## 7. Conclusion



The three principal measures of central tendency perform especially well in combination because their benefits and disadvantages are similar. However, based on the scale of measurement of the data set, only one or two of them may apply to the dataset. That's all for the topic measures of central tendency. Our next topic will be measures of dispersion.
