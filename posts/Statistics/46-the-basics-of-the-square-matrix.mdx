# **The Basics of The Square Matrix**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

Among the most extensively utilized concepts in linear algebra has been the matrix. The mathematical explanation of a square matrix, its effects, and its instances are all discussed in detail in this tutorial.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What is the square matrix?
* What are the types of Square Matrices?
* Diagonal of a Square Matrix? 


## 3. What is the square matrix?

The nxn matrix, which includes the same number of rows and columns, is regarded as a square matrix. It provides an effective and efficient technique for evaluating, organizing, and providing facts in a systematic way. The matrix enables estimating complex computations and is applied in mathematical formulas too. There are some of the more significant variants of matrices.


## 4. What are the types of Square Matrices?

The following list comprises a selection of the most fundamental square matrix kinds.



1. singular matrix → whose determinant is 0, → we can’t have the inverse of a singular matrix.
2. non- singular matrix → det != 0, —> inverse
3. identity matrix→ diagonal element = 1, all will be 0 → special square of square matrix
1. **Invertible Matrix**

A square matrix is described as invertible when the identity matrix responds by multiplying the matrix through its inverse. An identity matrix is a matrix having a principal diagonal comprised entirely of 1s as well as other values equal to 0s.



2. **Symmetric Matrix **

The square matrix also includes one that is symmetric which is as follows:

here: 

 is the transpose of the matrix; 

By switching rows into one of the columns either column into one of the rows, we obtain a matrix's transpose. The character "T" is applied to notify that the matrix has been transposed.

= 

 ( A2,3 = A3,2)

In the above equation 

is rearranged if 

= I  (identity matrix)  

= I (identity matrix) 

Where I is Identitymatrix.



3. **Singular Matrix**

A matrix which has zero determinant is called Singular matrix. 

A singular matrix is a matrix that cannot be inversed. For instance, when a matrix's first column's attribute is 0, the determinant would also be zero.

Invertible matrices aren't made up of singular matrices. 


**Note:**

The computation of the determinant value is only permissible by the square matrix.


## 5. Characteristics of The Square Matrix

The following is a listing of some of the significant features of square matrices:



* The word "trace of a matrix" indicates the summation of each of the diagonal components of a square matrix.
* In a square matrix, equal numbers of columns and rows are maintained.
* The term identity matrix is given to the square matrix when every element equals 1.


## 6. Conclusion

In data science matrix is used as a basic data framework that is able to process information and handle linear equations. Matrices are used in image processing, and array manipulation.

This is all about the square matrix. Our following topic will be the triangular matrix.
