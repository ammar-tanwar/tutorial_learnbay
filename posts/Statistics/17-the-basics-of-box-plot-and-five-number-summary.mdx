##  1. The Overview of the Tutorial

A box and whisker plot is a figure describing a five-number summary. When multiple data sets are analyzed, a five-number summary is created for each with a corresponding box and whisker plot.


##  2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What are the five-number Summary and the whiskers plot?
* How do we perform it?


##  3. Definition of a box plot and five-number summary

Figure 1: Box and Whiskers Plots and the 5-number summary

The box plot has all of the features such as Mean, Median, Lower quartile, Upper quartile, and extreme values, and it essentially allows you to see the data's significant qualities in a visual format.

 
### 5 number summary 
It is a numerical representation of the box plot. It consists of:

●	The Median (2nd Quartile) 

●	The 1st  Quartile 

●	3rd  Quartile 

●	Maximum value

●	Minimum value

 

Let’s see how to draw a box plot

Suppose you have a data set 

34, 18, 100, 27, 54, 52, 93, 59, 61, 87, 68, 85, 78, 82, 91

Step 1: You’ll have to re-arrange the data set in ascending order. 

18, 27, 34, 52, 54, 59, 61, 68, 78, 82, 85, 87, 91, 93, 100

Step 2: Find the below values from the data set. 

18, 27, 34, 52, 54, 59, 61, 68, 78, 82, 85, 87, 91, 93, 100

Minimum value: 18

Maximum value: 100

Q1: 52


### **_Note:_**

_Finding the median that is the middle value of the data set's lower and upper half is quartile 1 **(Q1)** and quartile 3 **(Q3)**. _

Median: 68

Q3: 87

One simple trick is first to find out the median then it’ll be easy to find the 25th and the 75th percentile values. 

Step 3: Now, according to our data set, we might be guessing what if we have an even number of data sets.

2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 19, 20

So now we have 10 total values and we cannot just split it into two halves 

{2, 4, 5, 6,} 7, 8, {9, 11, 19, 20}

7+8 = 15

15 divided by 2 = 7.5

Hence the median is 7.5

2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7.5, 8, 9, 11, 19, 20

Minimum value: 2

Maximum value: 20

Q1: 5    

Median: 7.5

Q3: 11    


### Points to remember. 

●	Once you have calculated all these values you can easily plot the box plot. 

●	Always place the Median line according to the median value we get then it will make the box plot clear visually. 


##  4. Advantages of Box Plot and Five Point Summary

Box and whisker plots can gather data from several sources and then represent the result in a single graph, making them highly efficient and simple to read. Box and whisker plots enable us to check the data from several domains for faster, better decision-making.


##  5. Disadvantages of Box Plots



* Box plots hide the literary texts and other distributional characteristics which can be confusing to several observers.
* Sometimes tough to access mean.
* Outlier computation is also too inflexible.
* "Outliers" can sometimes be predicated on an organization or would be unique for every individual.


##  6. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned about box plots and five-number summaries with some advantages and disadvantages. I hope you all understood the topic clearly. Our following topic will be Outliers.
