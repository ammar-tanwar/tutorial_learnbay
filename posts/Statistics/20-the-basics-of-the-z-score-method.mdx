## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial



The Z-score method enables statisticians and analysts to determine if a score falls within the standard for a specific data set or differs from it. Analysts can also change scores from several sets of data with Z-scores to obtain scores that are more precisely similar to one another.



## 2. Scope of The Tutorial





* What is Z-Score?


* How do we perform the Z-Score method?




## 3. Definition of the Z-Score method



A Z-score method is a measurement that determines how near a value corresponds to the mean of a range of values. Standard deviations from the mean are applied to calculate Z-score. A Z-score of 0 signifies that the data point's score is exactly the same as the mean score. A number that is one standard deviation away from the mean would get a Z-score of 1.0. Z-scores can either be positive or negative, with a positive value representing a score above the mean and a negative number suggesting a score below the mean.

**_Note:_**

_We will discuss, in detail, the 'standard deviation' and 'mean' in our following tutorial._



## 4. Importance of Z-Score

Z-scores are essential as they allow for comparing two scores that don't fall into a similar normal distribution. They are again used to determine the possibility that a z-score will occur inside a normal distribution. A minus z-score signifies that the raw data is lower than the mean.



## 5. Usage of Z-Score





Z-scores allow observations to be compared with those of a "normal" population. There are countless possible outcomes and unit variations for test or survey outcomes, and those outcomes can seem pointless if we would like to compare anyone's weight to the "average" person's weight. For example, noting that someone weighs 150 pounds may be valuable information, but reading a big table of data can be stressful (when some weights are recorded in kilograms). A z-score will inform you how another person's weight relates to the mean weight of the overall population.



## 6. How do we perform Z-Score?




The essential formula for a sample's z score is:

Let's imagine, for example, that your test score was 190. The test's standard deviation (σ) is 25 since the mean (μ) is 150. The z score will be as follows, considering a normal distribution:

z = (x – μ) / σ

= (190 – 150) / 25 = 1.6

The score's standard deviation from the mean is given by the z-score. The score in this example is 1.6 standard deviations above the mean.



## 7. Conclusion




The standard score commonly referred to as a z-score is a very helpful statistic because that enables us to analyze scores across different normal distributions and determine the probability that a particular score will fall within our normal distribution.

This was all about the z-score. Our following topic will be on measures of central tendency.
