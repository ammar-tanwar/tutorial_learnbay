# **The Basics of Baye's Theorem**


## 1. The Overview Of The Tutorial


The Bayes theorem is implemented in Bayesian classification for estimating the likelihood of any event. Statistical approaches with Bayesian probability understandings are known as Bayesian statistical tests. The theory suggests how probability is able to define a level of certainty.


## 2. Scope of the Article

 


●  	In this article, we will learn about Baye's Theorem and


●  	How Baye’s Theorem is applied.

 


## 3. Baye's Theorem-Explained


Baye’s theorem is usually called Bayes' law or Bayes' rule. The theorem is named after Thomas Bayes’, an 18th-century British mathematician. It defines the probability of an accident based on information about situations. This situation could be connected with probability theory and statistics.

 

For instance, using the Bayes theorem instead of assuming that a person is an average for the community as a whole enables the health hazard to a person of known age to be analyzed more accurately. This is advantageous when the risk of acquiring health issues grows with age.



## 4. Applications of Baye's Theorem


Bayesian inference is a unique method of statistical inference and is one of the many' . The theorem's probabilities may have several probability interpretations according to the way they are applied. The theorem describes how a probability-based degree of assumption should logically alter to take into account the existence of important evidence using Bayesian probability interpretation.

 

The Bayes theorem is applied in many fields of statistics, especially medicine and pharmacology, serving as two notable examples. The theorem is very often used in various sectors of business.

 


## 5. How to perform Baye's theorem?


The formula for Bayes’ Theorem:



Where P(x) means probability of x



* Probability of event A is by itself, indicated as P (A)
* Probability of event B is by itself, indicated as P (B)
* Probability of event A given that event B has already occurred, represented as P(A|B)
* Probability of event B given that event A has already occurred, represented as P(B|A)

 

Example:

Let’s assume that P(Fire) is the Probability of fire and P(Smoke) is the Probability of seeing smoke, then:

P(Fire|Smoke) indicates the likelihood of fire when smoke is already there.

P(Smoke|Fire) indicates the likelihood of smoke appearing in the presence of fire.

Given that we already know P(Smoke|Fire) to be "backward," the formula sort of gives us P(Fire|Smoke) to be "forwards."


* 1% of all fires are disastrous.
* Although smoke (10%) is typical owing to barbecues,
* Around 90% of disastrous fires cause smoke

The probability of a disastrous fire happening in the presence of smoke can then be determined:


=


Hence, it continues to be necessary to detect any smoke.

 


## 6. Conclusion


The use of Bayesian inference has added advantages. For example, a strong decision theory framework presents a natural and acceptable method of combining previous knowledge with facts. A prior distribution can be built for future analyses by combining historical data on a parameter.
