# **The Basics of The One-tailed and Two-tailed Tests**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

Considering asymmetric distributions having a single tail, one-tailed tests are conducted. However, checking the null hypothesis and estimating statistical significance equally require a two-tailed test.


## 2. Scope of The Tutorial



* What are one-tailed test?
* Example for one-tailed test.
* What are two-tailed test?
* Example for two-tailed test.


## 3. What is one-tailed test?

The significant concern of a distribution in a one-tailed test is one-sided, indicating that it is limited to being higher than or lesser than a specific value but not both. The alternative hypothesis should be accepted in place of the null hypothesis when the sample for the test lies in the one-sided critical region.

Figure 1: One-Tailed test


**Note:**

The researcher must offer a null and alternative hypothesis as well as a probability value prior to conducting a one-tailed test.


## 4. Example of The One-Tailed test

Assume that a researcher is attempting to establish that a portfolio manager topped the S&P 500 index with 16.91% in a precise year. The alternative (

) and null (

) hypotheses should then be put up as:

=

16.91

=

>16.91

The result the researcher attempts to reject is defined as the null hypothesis. The researcher's conclusion that the portfolio manager topped the S&P 500 is the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis should be approved when the results of the one-tailed test reject the null hypothesis. And on contrary, when the experimental findings don't match the null hypothesis, the researcher should look into the portfolio manager's record thoroughly.

The region of rejection usually spreads to one end of the sample distribution, in a one-tailed test. The researcher must perform an upper-tailed significance test where the higher values fall in the upper tail which is at the right side of the normal distribution curve, for identifying how such a portfolio's investment performance is compared to the market index. The researcher will be able to identify how much greater the portfolio return is in comparison to the index return or whether the difference is considerable by conducting a one-tailed test withinin the upper or right tail segment of the curve.


## 5. What is the two-tailed test?

A two-tailed test in statistics identifies when a sample is higher than or below a specific set of values by applying two critical regions of distribution. It is applied in testing the null hypothesis and estimating statistical significance. The alternative hypothesis is preferred in place of the null hypothesis when any of the crucial regions corresponds to the sample during the test.

Figure 2: Two-Tailed test


**Note:**

A two-tailed test is conducted to assess both ends of a data set which has been determined by the probability distribution at practice.


## 6. Example of The two-Tailed Test

You that you are now employed with ABC as the stockbroker, and XYZ, a newcomer stockbroker, states that your stockbroker costs are less. The mean and standard deviation including all ABC broker customers, as per available information from an online research group, are $18 and $6, accordingly.

The newcomer XYZ broker fees were used to determine stockbroker costs for a number of 100 ABC customers. Could this be concluded concerning the difference in the normal brokerage service charge amongst brokers ABC and XYZ when the sample mean is $18.75 and the sample standard deviation is $6?


 is null hypothesis that is the mean which is 18

 is alternative hypothesis which is mean &lt;> 18 (This is what we are attempting to prove).

Rejection region is Z&lt;= 

 and Z>= 

 (that we assume a 5% significance level, breaking the results into 2.5 on each side).

Z equals (sample mean – mean) / (std-dev / sqrt (number of samples)) 

which is (18.75 – 18) / (6/(sqrt(100)) = 1.25

The calculation estimated Z value lies within the two boundaries described by the values of  

= -1.96 and 

=1.96.

It means that there is insufficient information to generate the assumption that the prices offered by your current stockbroker and the new stockbroker are distinct in any way. 

This implies that the null hypothesis could be rejected. Therefore, identical result is attained through the use of the p-value = P(Z&lt; -1.25)+P(Z >1.25) = 2 * 0.1056 = 0.2112 = 21.12%, which is higher compared to 0.05 or 5%.


## 7. Conclusion

In this tutorial we learned one-tailed and two-tailed tests with examples. This is all about the one-tail and two-tail test. Our following topic will be critical value.
