**Introducing Measures of Skewness**


## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial



There are two types of measures in descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency and measures of variability (or spread).


Measures of central tendency and measures of variability are two components of descriptive statistics. The mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency, while the standard deviation, variance, and _measures of skewness and kurtosis_ are examples of variability measures.



**Note:**


**_The Kurtosis topic will be covered in our next tutorial._**

## 2. Scope of The Tutorial




●  	_Skewness meaning_?


●  	What forms of skewness are there?


●  	Calculation of the skewness?


## 3. Expanding ‘skewness meaning’?



Skewness simply determines the distribution's symmetry. In statistics, skewness is the consequence of an imbalance in a probability distribution function that varies from the perfectly straight normal distribution of a bell curve in the specified data collected.


To estimate variability, you can use the normal distribution. Samples are symmetrically distributed if we discuss the normal distribution. As a result, all measures for a central tendency settle in the middle, and the symmetrical distribution will have no skewness.

## 4. What are the different types that exist in 'measures of skewness?'





# 1. **Positive skewed or right-skewed:**


In statistical terms, a positively skewed distribution represents the data. Each measure of the central tendency that comprises mean, median, and mode is identical to each other in comparison to symmetrically distributed data, and the measures are different for positively skewed data.


Consequently, positively skewed distributions include those in which the mean, median, and mode of the spread remain positive instead of just zero or negative.

  **Figure 2: Right-Skewed distribution**

Positively skewed numbers get a mean that is higher than their median and a large number of data-pushed on the right-hand side. In positively skewed, the consequences are skewed to the negative. Although the mean is mostly greater than the median as well as the median is the middle number, the mean would have to be higher.


Extremely positive skewness is improper distribution, as it could lead to unreliable results.




# 1. **Negative skewed or left-skewed:**


The total opposite of a positively skewed distribution would be a negatively skewed distribution. A negatively skewed distribution occurs when the tail of the distribution extends towards the left, whereas the majority of the data are depicted on the graph's right-hand side whenever making a reference to a distribution model in statistics.


When the data is negatively skewed as well as heavily skewed towards the left, then the mean is smaller in comparison to the median. Distribution is assumed to be negatively skewed when its mean, median, and mode are negative as compared to positive or zero.

  **Figure 3: Left-Skewed Distribution**

The median will have to be higher than the mean as a result of skewed distribution. The mode is the biggest value, whereas the median is the middle value.


## 5. Determining The Sample's Skewness Score



In the measures of skewness, determine the standard deviation from the results before deducting the mode from the mean.


  Pearson’s first coefficient= Mean-ModeStandard Deviation

The value is reduced in size to a limited range of -1 to +1 once we divide the covariance values by the standard deviation. While a zero value suggests that there is no linear connection, the Pearson correlation coefficient extends from -1, that further represents a perfect negative linear relationship, through +1, denoting a perfect positive linear relationship. It displays the correlation values' range correctly.


Pearson's first skewness coefficient is significant when the data indicate a high mode. Conversely, Pearson's first coefficient is not recommended when the data consists of a low mode or multiple modes; therefore, in this case, Pearson's second coefficient could be favorable since it doesn't depend on the mode.


Divide the outcome by the standard deviation after multiplying the difference by three.


  Pearson’s first coefficient= 3(Mean-Median)Standard Deviation


  Mean-Mode = 3(Mean-Mode)

The skewness is much more symmetrical if it is between -0.5 and 0.5.

The values are slightly skewed when the skewness ranges between -1 and -0.5 (negative skewed) or between the range of 0.5 and 1 (positive skewed).


The data are significantly skewed when the skewness is less than -1 (negative biased) or more than 1 (positive skewed).

## 6. Conclusion



In this tutorial, we learned what skewness is, what its types are, and how it is calculated. This is all about skewness. Our following topic will be kurtosis.
