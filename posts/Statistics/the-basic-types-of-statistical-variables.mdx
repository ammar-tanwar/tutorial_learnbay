## 1. The Overview of The Tutorial

Variables are statistically significant as they simplify the implementation of concepts for data gathering. Researchers can discover cause-and-effect interactions by appropriately switching some characteristics in an experiment and observing what occurs as a consequence. So, having a clear idea about the types of statistical variables is too significant for data science and AI.


## 2. Scope of The Article



* What is a Variable?
* How is a variable useful?
* What are its types? 


## 3. Definition of Variables in Statistics

Any characteristic, frequency, or value that can be measured or recorded is a variable. In other terms, a variable is considered a quality of a research item. An effective experimental method relies on the choice of the factors to be studied.

_For example:_ "earnings" is a variable that could vary between data units of a sample (i.e., the persons or companies being analyzed would not have the same earnings), and even within every data unit over time may vary (i.e. income can go up or down).

A set of data is another term for a variable. Since the value may vary within data units inside a population or might change over time, it is considered a variable.

## 4. Types of Statistical Variables

Usually, depending on how the variables are examined, recorded, and displayed, statistical variables can be expressed in several ways.



1. **Numeric variables or quantitative variables:**

Whenever we gather quantitative information, the numbers we note represent sums that can be multiplied, divided, added, etc. Quantitative variables are divided into two categories _discrete_ and _continuous_.



* **A continuous variable:**

    Arithmetical variables are continuous variables. A certain value between a predefined set of real numbers can be used in the analysis. For a continuous variable, the number set for analysis can vary as lower as the measurement device allows. 


    The following are several examples of continuous variables: age, climate, weight, and duration.

* **A Discrete Variable:**

    Integer variables are discrete variables. An observation's number can be calculated from a sum of a set of whole unique values. A fraction between one number with the next nearest value cannot be used as a value for a discrete variable.


    Example: The number of registered vehicles, the number of company locations, and the number of children living in a house are all discrete variables that are measurable as whole units (i.e. 1, 2, 3 vehicles). 

1. **Categorical variables or qualitative variables:**

    Elements for categorical variables define a "quality" or "feature" of a data unit, which includes "what type" or "what factor." Following are the two main types of categorical variable classifications: exhaustive (with all possibilities) and mutually exclusive (with one classification or another). Categorical variables are hence qualitative variables and generally have a non-numeric value as their description.

* **An ordinal variable:**

  A categorical variable consists of ordinals. The quality that observations can have can be logically ranked or organized. Even though each classification for an ordinal variable can be placed higher or lower compared to others, there cannot always be a numerical difference between them. 

Example: College grades (such as A, B, or C), apparel sizes (such as short and larger sizes), and opinions (i.e. approved and not approved) can be taken as examples of ordinal categorical variables.



* **A Nominal Variable:**

    Categorical variables also provide nominal variables. A variable that cannot be structured logically is being taken in observations. 


    Example: Age, professional business, facial characteristics, faith, and trademark are several instances of nominal categorical variables.



## 5. Conclusion

Studying variables is essential as they function as the basic elements of the data analyzed and evaluated in research studies. When conducting survey design or understanding the conclusions of an experiment, researchers thoroughly consider and assess the value(s) from every variable to figure out how things interact with each other.
